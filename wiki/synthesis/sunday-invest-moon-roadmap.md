# Sunday Invest Moon — Roadmap (cross-agent handoff)

> [verified 2026-06-05] **Cross-agent contract.** This file is the single source of truth for the Sunday Invest Moon refactor (formerly Pixel Wealth Quest). It lives in A-Wiki so Codex / Antigravity / Manus / Cursor / Claude can pick up where the previous agent left off without context-loss.
>
> **Source-of-truth policy**:
> 1. Edit only `A-Wiki/wiki/synthesis/sunday-invest-moon-roadmap.md` — canonical, git-tracked, FTS5-indexed (`python3 scripts/wiki/search-wiki.py "sunday invest moon"`).
> 2. `sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest/ROADMAP.md` is a product-repo mirror for agents working there. Do not edit it independently.
> 3. After every roadmap edit, run `python3 scripts/game/sync_sunday_invest_moon_roadmap.py --sync`, then run the same command without `--sync` to verify both copies match.
>
> **Code module**: `sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest/` · **GDD**: `A-Wiki/wiki/synthesis/pixel-wealth-quest-gdd.md` (rename header to Sunday Invest Moon when Phase 2c.1 ships).

---

## 60-second cold start (any Agent / IDE)

1. Read `## RESUME HERE`; it overrides stale TODOs in `HANDOFF.md`, chat transcripts, and local Claude plan files.
2. Read only the named ticket plus `Context`, `Cross-cutting reuse map`, and `Iron-Law guardrails`.
3. From A-Wiki, run `python3 scripts/agent-preflight.py` and `python3 scripts/game/sync_sunday_invest_moon_roadmap.py`.
4. From `sunday-estate-webapp`, confirm `git status --short --branch` before editing because another Agent may have unfinished work.
5. Claim the ticket by changing its status to `[~]` in the canonical roadmap and syncing the mirror before implementation.

`~/.claude/plans/...` is archival input only. It is machine-local and must never be treated as the current handoff source.

---

## How to use this file (agent protocol)

1. **Read the section `## RESUME HERE`** — it names the next ticket and the last-touched file.
2. **Open the matching `### Ticket 2c.X.Y` block** — it has a Goal, exact files to touch, the patterns to reuse, and a Done-when checklist.
3. **Do the work in a single focused pass.** Don't merge tickets — each ticket is sized for ~1 hour / one chat session.
4. **Update the ticket status checkbox**: `[ ]` → `[~]` (started) → `[x]` (done). Append a one-line note under the ticket: `> 2026-MM-DD <agent-name>: <what you did, what to verify next>`.
5. **Move the `## RESUME HERE` anchor to the next ticket.**
6. **Sync the product mirror** with `python3 scripts/game/sync_sunday_invest_moon_roadmap.py --sync`, verify with the same command without `--sync`, then commit both repos as applicable.
7. If you can't finish a ticket: leave it `[~]`, write a `> blocker:` note, and move RESUME HERE to the next *independent* ticket. Don't half-finish silently.

**Status legend** in this file:
- `[ ]` not started
- `[~]` in progress / blocked (read the note below the ticket)
- `[x]` done + verified

**Iron Law (non-negotiable for every ticket)**:
1. No production code without a failing test first.
2. No bug fix without root cause documented.
3. No API keys, secrets, or order-execution in the client. Period.
4. `raw/` is immutable. `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` need explicit approval to edit.

---

## RESUME HERE

**Next ticket**: **Ticket 16.1 — Save-version migration ladder (foundation, test-first)**  
**Last touched**: All Phase 16 tickets 16.1–16.7 staged as implementation patches in `A-Wiki/docs/phase-16-staging/` (session 2026-06-14). Product repo = `aase7en/sunday-estate-webapp` (pixel-wealth-quest subdir). Apply patches in a session with that repo in scope.
**Suggested run order for the next agent**: 16.1 → 16.2 ⭐ → 16.3 → 16.4 → 16.5 → 16.6 → 16.7 → 16.8 → 16.9 → 16.10. Each ticket is one focused session; commit `chunk(16.X): goal [next: 16.Y]` and push at each boundary.
**Product repo**: `aase7en/sunday-estate-webapp` · `pixel-wealth-quest/` subdir. (Formerly referenced as `Aase7en-InW-Wiki` — that repo is deleted.)
**Branch policy**: commit straight to `main` of both repos (A-Wiki + sunday-estate-webapp) — no PR, no worktree (per `A-Wiki/CLAUDE.md` rule #6).

---

## Context (what's already shipped)

Phase 2a/2b complete: 5 baked house rooms, top-down farm, น้องซันเดย์ with 8-dir walk + idle/run/sit/lie/eat/cry, **three real chihuahuas (red/black/cream) with PixelLab walk+sit+wag in all 8 directions**, parchment HUD, family-photo modal, click-to-move free vector inside rooms via `roomFreeMovement.ts`. Build is **green** (typecheck clean, 64 vitest tests, no console errors, React Doctor ≈100).

**Confirmed scope decisions** (user picked these in plan mode, locked):
| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Bot trading | **MOCK first** + adapter seam for a future backend service (no live orders in client) |
| Open-world farm | **Bigger grid + camera scrolls with player** (~30×20 cells, single FarmScene) — not chunk streaming |
| Title screen | **1 button "เริ่มเกม"** (no Continue/Settings yet) |
| Click-to-move | **A* pathfinding** around obstacles |

---

## Theme palette (locked — every UI ticket pulls from here)

Sampled from the user-supplied splash art `Gemini_Generated_Image_251ghe251ghe251g.png`. New tokens are added to `src/styles/tokens.css` **in addition to** the existing parchment vars (parchment stays for FamilyPanel/PetBioPanel text-heavy modals; lawn/wood is for chips, buttons, title).

```css
:root {
  --sim-lawn:       #86c34a; /* primary green */
  --sim-lawn-dark:  #5b8a2f;
  --sim-wood:       #8b5a2b; /* sign body */
  --sim-wood-dark:  #3a2010; /* sign outline */
  --sim-cream:      #fff4da; /* highlight text */
  --sim-cream-2:    #f4e9c8;
  --sim-red:        #c92828; /* "AI Market Ventures" red */
  --sim-sky:        #a3d4ee; /* subtle UI backdrop */
}
```

## Phase 2c.1 — Rename + Theme + Title + Logo + Responsive shell

Foundation. Every later phase depends on this.

### Ticket 2c.1.1 — Ingest title splash + logo images  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Title art + small logo live in the product repo + archived in A-Wiki references.
**Source files** (user-provided, in `~/Downloads/`):
- `Gemini_Generated_Image_251ghe251ghe251g.png` — splash background (lawn + sign + characters)
- `Gemini_Generated_Image_cy1pv5cy1pv5cy1p.png` — sign logo, transparent
**Destinations**:
- Product: `sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest/public/assets/title/sunday-invest-moon-splash-v001.jpg` (downscaled 1280×720 + JPEG q85 = 208 KB)
- Product: `sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest/public/assets/title/sunday-invest-moon-logo-v001.png` (88 KB, transparent)
- Archive (A-Wiki): `game-assets/references/sunday-invest-moon/title/{splash,logo}-v001.png` (full-res originals 6.1 MB + 88 KB)
**Done when**:
- [x] Files exist at the destinations
- [x] `du -h` both files → splash 208 KB (JPG), logo 88 KB — both well under 1 MB
- [x] Note: splash is `.jpg` (no transparency needed); Ticket 2c.1.3 preload path uses `.jpg`
> 2026-06-04 claude-opus-4-7: ingested via Bash cp + PIL downscale (NEAREST to preserve pixel art). Original 2730×1536 PNG kept as A-Wiki ref. **RESUME** → 2c.1.2.

---

### Ticket 2c.1.2 — Rename "Pixel Wealth Quest" → "Sunday Invest Moon" (user-facing only)  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Every label the user sees says "Sunday Invest Moon". The directory slug `pixel-wealth-quest/` does NOT change (would break iframe URL + dozens of import paths).
**Files to touch** (use `grep -rln "Pixel Wealth Quest" sunday-estate-webapp/ A-Wiki/wiki/` to verify the full set):
- `sunday-estate-webapp/prototype/src/data.jsx` — nav entry `pwq: { th, en }`
- `sunday-estate-webapp/prototype/src/app.jsx` — `PwqFrame` title
- `sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest/index.html` — `<title>`
- `sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest/src/App.tsx` — visible headings
- `sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest/HANDOFF.md` — update game name section
- `A-Wiki/wiki/synthesis/pixel-wealth-quest-gdd.md` — add "Renamed to **Sunday Invest Moon** in Phase 2c.1" note
- New copy: `sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest/ROADMAP.md` ← copy this file
- New copy: `A-Wiki/wiki/synthesis/sunday-invest-moon-roadmap.md` ← copy this file
**Tagline**: "AI Market Ventures" · **Footer**: "© 2006 Sunday Estate Co.,Ltd"
**Done when**:
- [x] No user-visible label still says "Pixel Wealth Quest"
- [x] `grep -rln "Pixel Wealth Quest"` only matches internal comments / legacy ADR / historical headers
- [x] `npm --prefix sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest run typecheck` green
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Renamed nav, iframe, and document-title labels; added tagline/footer plus `branding.test.ts`. Verified 66 tests, typecheck/build, prototype JSX parse, React Doctor 100/100. Browser localhost QA was blocked by Browser URL policy. **RESUME** → 2c.1.3.

---

### Ticket 2c.1.3 — TitleScene + "เริ่มเกม" button  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Game opens to a title screen. One button starts the room.
**New file**: `sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest/src/phaser/scenes/TitleScene.ts`
- `preload`: `this.load.image('sim_title_splash', 'assets/title/sunday-invest-moon-splash-v001.jpg')`
- `create`: full-bleed image (cover), then a DOM/HTML button "เริ่มเกม" centred-bottom. Click → `scene.start('Room')`.
**Edit**: `sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest/src/phaser/PhaserGame.ts` — scene array becomes `[BootScene, PreloadScene, TitleScene, RoomScene, FarmScene]`. `PreloadScene.create()` → `scene.start('Title')` (was `'Room'`).
**Reuse**: existing `Phaser.Scale.RESIZE` config (no change). Style the button using `var(--sim-wood)` for bg, `var(--sim-cream)` text, `var(--sim-wood-dark)` border.
**Done when**:
- [x] Opening the iframe shows splash + button
- [x] Click/tap button → Room renders
- [x] No console errors
- [x] Runtime screenshots captured + added to HANDOFF.md
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Playwright verified splash/button, title→Room, clean console, and recorded screenshot evidence in HANDOFF.md. **RESUME** → 2c.1.4.

---

### Ticket 2c.1.4 — Top-left HUD logo chip  · `[x]`
**Goal**: While playing, the small wooden sign sits top-left of the HUD.
**Edit**: `sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest/src/components/HudOverlay.tsx` — add `<img className="sim-hud-logo" src="assets/title/sunday-invest-moon-logo-v001.png" alt="Sunday Invest Moon" />`
**Edit**: `sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest/src/styles/hud.css` — `.sim-hud-logo { position: absolute; top: 12px; left: 12px; width: clamp(80px, 12vw, 140px); image-rendering: pixelated; z-index: 10; pointer-events: none; }`
**Done when**:
- [x] Logo visible top-left in Room + Farm
- [x] Logo does not block click zones (`pointer-events: none`)
- [x] Logo scales sanely on mobile widths
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added shared HUD logo + collision-free chip offset; regression test verifies asset/alt and CSS verifies pointer-events/clamp. Verified 70 tests, typecheck/build, React Doctor 100. **RESUME** → 2c.1.5.

---

### Ticket 2c.1.5 — Theme tokens (add `--sim-*` palette)  · `[x]`
**Goal**: New lawn-green/wood-brown palette available app-wide as CSS vars, without removing existing parchment tokens.
**Edit**: `sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest/src/styles/tokens.css` — append the `--sim-*` block from the "Theme palette (locked)" section of this file.
**Edit**: `sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest/src/styles/hud.css` — change `.pwq-chip` bg to `var(--sim-wood)`, text to `var(--sim-cream)`, border to `var(--sim-wood-dark)`. **Keep** `.pwq-family`, `.pwq-panel` on parchment (text readability).
**Done when**:
- [x] HUD chip reads warm wood-brown, not parchment
- [x] FamilyPanel still parchment-style
- [x] No CSS lint warnings
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added locked `--sim-*` palette and moved only `.pwq-chip` to wood/cream while preserving parchment panels. Verified CSS contracts, 70 tests, typecheck/build, React Doctor 100. **RESUME** → 2c.1.6.

---

### Ticket 2c.1.6 — Responsive shell (mobile breakpoints)  · `[x]`
**Goal**: PWQ usable on iPhone 12 (390×844) and iPad (768×1024).
**Pattern to copy**: `sunday-estate-webapp/game/src/styles/hud.css` (Tide & Tally), lines ~144–750 (`@media (max-width: 920px)`, `@media (orientation: portrait)` blocks). Adapt to PWQ class names (`.pwq-*`, `.sim-*`).
**Edit**: `sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest/index.html` — confirm `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">` present.
**Add**: `src/logic/platform.ts` (test-first) — `isTouchDevice()` returning `'ontouchstart' in window || navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0`. Used in Phase 2c.2 to swap on-screen control hints. Tests in `src/logic/platform.test.ts`.
**Done when**:
- [x] Runtime resize 390×844 → no horizontal scroll, no overlap
- [x] Runtime resize 768×1024 → same
- [x] `npm test` green (platform.test.ts passes)
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Playwright verified title, Room/inventory, and Farm/IoT layouts at 390×844 and 768×1024 without horizontal overflow or overlap. **RESUME** → 2c.2.1.

---

## Phase 2c.2 — Click/tap-to-move with A* pathfinding

### Ticket 2c.2.1 — `src/logic/pathfind.ts` + test  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Pure A* implementation, no Phaser deps, deterministic.
**New file**: `src/logic/pathfind.ts` — `aStar(start: Cell, goal: Cell, grid: RoomGrid): Cell[] | null`
- 8-neighbour expansion (diag costs √2)
- Manhattan heuristic for axis-aligned, Octile for diagonal
- Returns `null` if unreachable
- Prevents corner-cut through diagonal blocked cells
**Reuse**: `Cell`, `RoomGrid` types from `src/types/domain.ts` + `src/logic/movement.ts`; `nextCell` for neighbour iteration.
**New file**: `src/logic/pathfind.test.ts` — cases: open grid, blocked corridor, unreachable, corner-cut guard, 1-cell path.
**Done when**:
- [x] All test cases pass
- [x] Path length matches expected (octile distance)
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added deterministic pure A* with octile heuristic and diagonal corner-cut guards. Verified 5 focused cases, 78 total tests, typecheck/build, and React Doctor 100. **RESUME** → 2c.2.2.

---

### Ticket 2c.2.2 — `screenToCell` inverse projection  · `[x]`
**Goal**: A pointer event in world coords → a grid cell.
**Edit**: `src/logic/grid.ts` — add `screenToCell(p: {x:number;y:number}, origin: GridOrigin): Cell` for both iso (rooms) and top-down (farm) projections. Write the inverse of the existing `cellToScreenIso` / `cellToScreenTopDown`.
**Tests**: `grid.test.ts` — round-trip `cellToScreen(c) → screenToCell(p) === c` for both projections.
**Done when**:
- [x] Round-trip tests pass for all 4 corners + centre
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added discriminated `GridOrigin` + `screenToCell()` inverse for iso/top-down projections. Verified 5-point round trips per projection, 80 total tests, typecheck/build, and React Doctor 100. **RESUME** → 2c.2.3.

---

### Ticket 2c.2.3 — `playerController` (path-driven walk)  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Player walks a precomputed path one cell at a time, with correct facing.
**New file**: `src/phaser/playerController.ts` — owns `targetPath: Cell[] | null`. Each scene update: if path non-empty, tween to `path[0]`, compute facing via `dir8FromVector`, play `playerMoveAnimKey('walk', dir)`. On arrival: shift path. On empty: idle.
**Reuse**: `dir8FromVector` (playerFrames.ts), `cellToScreenIso` (grid.ts), `screenDepth` (grid.ts), tween-walk pattern from `objects/PetPack.step()`.
**Edit**: `RoomScene.ts` + `FarmScene.ts` — register `this.input.on('pointerdown', e => { const cell = screenToCell({x: e.worldX, y: e.worldY}, origin); const path = aStar(this.player.cell, cell, this.grid); this.playerController.setPath(path); })`.
**Cancel logic**: any keyboard input → `setPath(null)`; reuse existing `movementVector()` for keyboard freeform.
**Done when**:
- [x] Click an empty cell → player walks there
- [x] Click the sofa → path-finds around it to the nearest free cell
- [x] Keyboard input mid-path cancels and takes over
- [x] Mobile tap = same behaviour (no separate code path)
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Calibrated the living sofa footprint against the 16:10 runtime frame, moved the initial spawn from blocked `3,3` to free `2,3`, and added regressions protecting obstacle/spawn/door cells. Playwright proved a sofa-centre click requests blocked `3,3`, builds a path, and stops at nearest free `3,2`. Verified 156 tests, typecheck/build, React Doctor 100, and console 0 errors/warnings. **RESUME** → 2c.3.3.

---

## Phase 2c.3 — Player action menu (click น้องซันเดย์)

### Ticket 2c.3.1 — Player click zone + modal state  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Tapping the player opens an action strip.
**Edit**: `RoomScene.ts` + `FarmScene.ts` — add a Phaser Zone on the player sprite (size = sprite bounds + 8px padding), `setInteractive`, on `pointerdown` → `pwqStore.setOpenModal('player-actions')`.
**Edit**: `pwqStore.ts` — extend modal union with `'player-actions'`.
**Done when**:
- [x] Tap player → store `openModal === 'player-actions'`
- [x] No conflict with tap-to-move (zone consumes the event)
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added reusable player hit zone that follows the sprite, opens `player-actions`, and stops pointer propagation before scene tap-to-move. Verified 87 tests, typecheck/build, and React Doctor 100. **RESUME** → 2c.3.2.

---

### Ticket 2c.3.2 — `PlayerActionStrip.tsx` UI  · `[x]`
**Goal**: 5 chips: นั่ง / นอน / ร้องไห้ / วิ่งเล่น / กิน.
**New file**: `src/components/PlayerActionStrip.tsx` — render when `openModal === 'player-actions'`. Each chip → `gameBus.emit('player-action', action)`; closing → `setOpenModal(null)`.
**Edit**: `HudOverlay.tsx` — render the strip in the modal slot.
**Reuse**: `pwq-chip` styling already in `hud.css`, gameBus already wired.
**Done when**:
- [x] Strip appears below player when modal open
- [x] Buttons fire actions
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Playwright visually verified the action strip beside/below the player and exercised the sit action without tap-to-move click-through. **RESUME** → 2c.3.3.

---

### Ticket 2c.3.3 — Action playback with hold/loop rules  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Each action plays per the user's exact frame rules.
**Edit**: `playerController.ts` — handle `gameBus.on('player-action', action)`:
- `sit` → play `sit_south_000..006`, on `animationcomplete` → `sprite.setTexture(playerAnimFrameKey('sit', 6))`. Hold until next walk or action.
- `lie` → same pattern, hold on `lie_south_006`.
- `cry` → play `cry_south_000..006` with `repeat: -1` (loop). Need to change `cry.repeat` from `0` → `-1` in `playerAnims.ts` (auto-generated). Either edit the generator's `REPEAT` map in `scripts/game/normalize_pwq_anims.py` and re-run, or override locally in `playerController` (`scene.anims.create` with same key but `repeat: -1`).
- `run` → play 8-dir run anim + wander randomly within walkArea for ~4s.
- `eat` → play `eat_south_000..006` once, return to idle.
**Cancel**: any tap-to-move click or keyboard input → stop animation + return to walk.
**Done when**:
- [x] นั่ง holds on frame 6 visibly
- [x] นอน holds on frame 6
- [x] ร้องไห้ loops forever until interrupted
- [x] วิ่งเล่น picks random cell and runs there
- [x] กิน plays once and returns to idle
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Extended the source-of-truth normalizer so run registers 8 directional keys: front uses real run art; missing directions reuse matching locomotion frames at 12 FPS. PlayerController now selects run by facing. Playwright verified `lie_006` hold plus live `run_back_left`/`run_front_right`; console stayed clean. Verified A-Wiki 253 tests, product 157 tests/typecheck/build, and React Doctor 100. **RESUME** → 2d.1.

---

## Phase 2c.4 — Pet click → bio popup

### Ticket 2c.4.1 — `pets.bios.ts` data table  · `[x]`
**New file**: `src/data/pets.bios.ts` — exported `PET_BIOS: Record<PetDogId, PetBio>`. Bio strings per the user's spec (verbatim Thai):

```ts
red (สุขใจ):
  portrait: 'assets/character/pets/individual/red/dog_red_front_001.png'
  sex: 'เมีย', born: 'ธันวาคม 2561'
  personality: 'หวงเจ้าของ เห่าเก่ง เห่าได้ทั้งวัน ดุร้ายเมื่อเจอคนแปลกหน้า'
  abilities: 'สั่งตายได้ ขอมือได้ หมุนตัวได้ หยิบของมาให้ได้'
  history: 'เป็นแม่ของ มั่งมี และ ศรีสุข ผ่าคลอดเพราะไปซื้อกินจนท้องไม่มีพ่อ ลูกเลยตัวใหญ่กว่าตัวเอง'

black (ศรีสุข):
  portrait: 'assets/character/pets/individual/black/dog_black_front_001.png'
  sex: 'ผู้', born: 'กุมภาพันธ์ 2564'
  personality: 'ขี้กลัว ปล่อยออกนอกบ้านก็หนีเข้าบ้าน ไม่เคยโดนหมาที่ไหนกัด เพราะซ่อนเก่ง ชอบกระเด้าขา เห่าตามแม่'
  history: 'เป็นลูกของ สุขใจ เป็นพี่น้องกับ มั่งมี'

cream (มั่งมี):
  portrait: 'assets/character/pets/individual/cream/dog_cream_front_000.png'
  sex: 'ผู้', born: 'กุมภาพันธ์ 2564'
  personality: 'ขี้เก่าเหมือนแม่ ใจกล้ามาก ไล่กัดหมาใหญ่ จนตัวเองโดนกัด'
  history: 'เป็นลูกของ สุขใจ เป็นพี่น้องกับ ศรีสุข'
  status: 'rip', statusNote: 'ปัจจุบัน: ตายแล้ว 🙏'
```

**Done when**:
- [x] File exports the typed record
- [x] All three portrait paths exist on disk
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added verbatim typed bios for red/black/cream dogs with RIP metadata for มั่งมี; verified all portrait files, 95 tests, typecheck/build. **RESUME** → 2c.4.2.

---

### Ticket 2c.4.2 — `PetBioPanel.tsx`  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Parchment modal like FamilyPanel; shows portrait + bio. `cream` gets a soft RIP treatment.
**New file**: `src/components/PetBioPanel.tsx` — mirror `FamilyPanel` (HudOverlay.tsx lines ~167–184). Title = ชื่อหมา, large portrait at top, meta grid below, RIP badge if `status === 'rip'` (small black/grey ribbon, not heavy).
**Edit**: `HudOverlay.tsx` — render when `openModal` matches `pet:red|pet:black|pet:cream`.
**Edit**: `pwqStore.ts` modal union — add `'pet:red'|'pet:black'|'pet:cream'`.
**Done when**:
- [x] Each dog opens its own panel
- [x] Cream shows RIP badge
- [x] Close button works
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added responsive parchment pet bio panel, typed pet modal routing, soft RIP badge, and close flow. Verified 98 tests, typecheck/build, and React Doctor 100. **RESUME** → 2c.4.3.

---

### Ticket 2c.4.3 — Pet click zones in `PetPack`  · `[x]`
**Edit**: `src/phaser/objects/PetPack.ts` — in `PetActor` setup, `sprite.setInteractive()` and `on('pointerdown', () => gameBus.emit('pet-clicked', dog.id))`.
**Edit**: gameBus listener in HudOverlay or App level → `pwqStore.setOpenModal(\`pet:\${id}\`)`.
**Caveat**: depth + tweens — the sprite is moving; verify the hit-area follows. Use `useHandCursor: true` on desktop only.
**Done when**:
- [x] Click each of the three dogs in the room → correct bio modal
- [x] Click works in farm scene too
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Made shared Room/Farm PetPack sprites interactive, consumed pointer propagation, added typed `pet-clicked` bridge + explicit HUD cleanup, and verified modal routing. Passed 100 tests, typecheck/build, and React Doctor 100. **RESUME** → 2c.5.1.

---

## Phase 2c.5 — Bug fixes

### Ticket 2c.5.1 — Player walk-west uses south-west art  · `[x]`
**Goal**: When walking horizontally left, use `walk_south-west_000..008.png` instead of `walk_west_*` (user said the SW frames read better at the game's 3/4 angle).
**Approach A (recommended, reversible)**: Edit `scripts/game/normalize_pwq_anims.py` — add a constant `WALK_LEFT_USES_SW = True`; in the walk emit logic, when `dir8 === 'left'`, point its frames at the `south-west` slice instead of `west`. Re-run normalize.
**Approach B (hand override)**: In `playerAnims.ts` (auto-generated), replace the `walk.left.frames` array with the `south-west` paths. Add a comment so the next normalize doesn't clobber it (or set the flag in A).
**Done when**:
- [x] Player walking left visibly uses SW frames
- [x] No regression on other directions
- [x] `playerAnims.test.ts` green
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Playwright runtime evidence confirmed west movement plays `pwq_player_walk_left` on the expected SW-backed texture key. **RESUME** → 2c.5.2.

### Ticket 2c.5.2 — Dogs wander truly omnidirectional (free vector)  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Today dogs step cell-by-cell, which reads as snapped/diagonal. Switch to free-vector wander while keeping the directional walk anim correct.
**Edit**: `src/logic/pet.ts` (+test) — replace `pickWander(): StepDir|null` with `pickWanderTarget(from, walkArea, rng): {dx:number, dy:number, distance:number}` returning a vector offset (1.5–3 tiles, any angle). Test new shape deterministically.
**Edit**: `src/phaser/objects/PetPack.ts` — replace cell-step tween with a free tween toward the vector target. Recompute `facing = dir8FromVector(velocity)` each tick → swap walk anim via `petMoveAnimKey(id, 'walk', facing)`. Respect grid bounds.
**Done when**:
- [x] Dogs walk smooth arcs, not diagonal jumps
- [x] Facing matches direction of motion in all 8 sectors
- [x] Bounds enforced (no walking through walls)
- [x] `pet.test.ts` updated + green
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Playwright before/after runtime samples confirmed live free-direction position, texture, and facing changes with smooth tweened wander. **RESUME** → 2c.6.1.

## Phase 2c.6 — Equal-size rooms

### Ticket 2c.6.1 — Normalize room viewport  · `[x]`
**Goal**: น้องซันเดย์'s sprite size doesn't visibly jump between rooms.
**Edit**: `RoomScene.ts` — backdrop scaling. Today: 98% × 90% of canvas. Add `ROOM_VIEWPORT_ASPECT = 16/10`; letterbox each backdrop to that aspect. Adjust grid origin per room so the playable floor area lines up across rooms.
**Done when**:
- [x] Walk room → room, player sprite size unchanged
- [x] No black bars wider than 2% of canvas in any room
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Playwright visually checked living↔office transitions plus desktop/mobile room layouts; player scale stayed consistent. **RESUME** → 2c.7.1.

---

## Phase 2c.7 — Inventory + Shop

### Ticket 2c.7.1 — `items.ts` registry  · `[x]`
**New file**: `src/data/items.ts` — `Item = { id, nameTh, category: 'seed'|'iot'|'food-human'|'food-dog', priceCoins, iconPath, descTh }`.

### Ticket 2c.7.2 — Generate IoT + item icons (PixelLab)  · `[x]`
**Goal**: 64×64 transparent PNGs in parchment-pixel style for every item.
**Tool**: extend `scripts/game/pixellab_generate_image.py` with `--icon` mode (passes `image_size: 64×64`, `pixelation_style: 'medium'`). Reference real-world devices in the prompt so it nails the IoT look:
- soil-moisture-watering: "pixel art icon of a tiny garden sprinkler with a soil moisture probe, top-down view, transparent background"
- pm25-sensor: "pixel art icon of a small white air quality sensor with a digital display"
- harvest-robot: "pixel art icon of a small wheeled harvest robot with a basket"
- ... (similar concrete prompts for the rest)
**Output**: `public/assets/items/iot/<slug>-v001.png`, `public/assets/items/seeds/<slug>-v001.png`, etc.
**Budget guard**: cap at $1.50 for this ticket. Echo balance via `python3 scripts/game/pixellab_gen.py balance` before/after.
**Done when**:

**Edit**: `RoomScene.ts` — in the office room, add a hotspot on the computer; `opens: 'shop'`.
**New file**: `src/components/ShopPanel.tsx` — category tabs, grid of items with price + buy button. On buy: check coins → decrement → addItem → toast.
**Edit**: `pwqStore.ts` modal union — add `'shop'`. Add `buy(itemId)` action that returns `{ok:boolean, reason?:string}` for testability.
**Tests**: `shop.test.ts` for buy logic (insufficient coins, valid buy).
**Done when**:
- [x] Click office computer → shop opens
- [x] Buy decreases coins + increases inventory
- [x] Insufficient coins → toast, no state change
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added office computer shop hotspot, atomic tested buy action, responsive category shop grid, balance display, and success/insufficient toast. Verified 127 tests, typecheck/build, and React Doctor 100. **RESUME** → 2c.8.1.

---

### Ticket 2c.8.2 — Harvest-Moon-style plot lifecycle  · `[x]`
**Edit**: `src/data/farm.seed.ts` — `FarmPlot.stage` enum becomes `untilled|tilled|seeded|growing|wet|ready|withered`.
**New file**: `src/logic/farm.ts` (+test) — pure stage-transition functions: `till(plot)`, `seed(plot, seedId)`, `water(plot)`, `harvest(plot)`. Wither rule: water level 0 for >N ticks → withered.
**New file**: `src/phaser/objects/ToolWheel.ts` — show when player adjacent to a plot; chips: hoe / seed / water / scythe. Tap → calls farm logic.
**Edit**: `FarmScene.ts` — render plot by stage (reuse existing carrot art; add tilled/wet/withered placeholder tints).
**Done when**:
- [x] Walk to plot → wheel appears
- [x] Hoe → tilled; seed (from inventory) → seeded; water → wet; wait → growing → ready; harvest → coins + remove inventory seed
- [x] `farm.test.ts` all transitions covered
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Playwright visibly verified adjacent ToolWheel and completed hoe→seed→water→ready→harvest, raising coins from 8 to 32. **RESUME** → 2c.8.3.

Tests prove there are no execution controls. Playwright verified desktop three-column layout, mobile single-column layout, no horizontal overflow, local date display, and clean console. Verified 196 tests, typecheck/build, and React Doctor 100. **RESUME** → 2e.6.

### Ticket 2e.6 — Out-of-band generator + runtime smoke  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Generate sanitized static JSON outside Vite and verify the complete 08:00 → gull → letter flow.
**Files**: product-local generator adapted from `game/tools/generate-briefing.mjs`, docs/handoff, runtime evidence.
**Done when**:
- [x] Generator reads server/author-time secret only, safety-checks output, and preserves last good JSON on failure
- [x] Runtime smoke covers canned + safe static JSON + unsafe fallback
- [x] Tests/typecheck/build/React Doctor, clean console, and client secret scan pass
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added author-time `npm run briefing:generate` backed by `tools/generate-briefing.mjs`; it reads only `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`/A-Wiki secrets outside Vite, safety-converts unknown model JSON, writes dated + `latest.json` atomically, and preserves existing static files when no key is available. Seeded safe 2026-06-05 static briefing with `source: live`. Playwright proved the full 08:00 Farm trigger: pending gull visible, click opened `news-bird`, pending cleared, `source=live`, 3 cards rendered, and console had 0 errors/0 warnings. Client scan found no key/generation strings in `src` or `public`. Verified 200 tests, typecheck/build, and React Doctor 100. Phase 2e complete. **RESUME** → 3.1.

## Phase 3 — Debt Dungeon (safe liabilities mechanic)

Promoted from the GDD after Phase 2e completed. Keep this as a coaching/visualization mechanic: no credit-product advice, no loan applications, no real account writes, and no shaming copy. Debt data starts mock/local only.

### Ticket 3.1 — Debt Dungeon domain + pure balance math  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Define the debt/liability model and pure monthly projection rules before any UI or scene work.
**Files**: new debt types/data/logic + tests; update GDD/HANDOFF status if needed.
**Done when**:
- [x] Mock liability entries distinguish good debt vs bad debt without moralizing language
- [x] Pure projection calculates balance, interest cost, minimum-payment progress, and payoff month estimate deterministically
- [x] Tests cover zero/overpayment, high-interest debt, asset-building debt, and Thai coaching labels without execution/financial-product advice
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added `Liability`/pressure types, non-shaming mock liabilities, and pure `projectLiability`/`summarizeLiabilities` logic. Test-first coverage proves high-interest vs asset-building classification, first-month interest/principal, payoff month estimates, overpayment closeout, under-interest stuck state, and safe Thai labels with no loan/product advice. Verified 206 tests, typecheck/build, React Doctor 100, and clean client secret scan. **RESUME** → 3.2.

### Ticket 3.2 — Debt Dungeon store state + HUD entry point  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Make Debt Dungeon data available in app state and expose a safe read-only HUD entry without building the full dungeon scene yet.
**Files**: `src/state/store.ts`, `HudOverlay.tsx`, small `DebtDungeonButton`/panel placeholder if needed, tests.
**Done when**:
- [x] Store initializes mock liabilities and exposes derived debt summary/projections without mutating source data
- [x] HUD has a clearly labeled read-only Debt Dungeon entry point
- [x] Tests prove no real credit application/order/write path exists
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added derived Debt Dungeon state (`debtLiabilities`, `debtProjections`, `debtSummary`), a bottom HUD entry button, and a read-only Debt Dungeon panel with aggregate balance/minimum-payment/high-interest/equity cards plus per-liability projection rows. Tests prove derived state is cloned, no debt pay/apply/borrow action exists, and the modal exposes no forbidden action buttons. Playwright proved start→open Debt Dungeon, heading/read-only copy visible, forbidden buttons=0, no horizontal overflow, and console 0 errors/0 warnings. Screenshot: `.playwright-cli/page-2026-06-04T23-28-28-681Z.png`. Verified 208 tests, typecheck/build, React Doctor 100, and production client scan clean. **RESUME** → 3.3.

### Ticket 3.3 — Debt Dungeon encounter cards + coaching copy  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Convert debt projections into non-shaming, read-only encounter cards that can later feed a dungeon scene/NPC coach.
**Files**: new pure encounter logic/data + tests; optional panel wiring after logic passes.
**Done when**:
- [x] Projection rows map deterministically to asset-building, high-pressure, stuck, and neutral encounter cards
- [x] Thai coaching copy explains interest pressure without shame, credit-product advice, or payment/order commands
- [x] Tests cover all pressure levels and prove cards contain no apply/borrow/pay-now language
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added pure `buildDebtEncounterCards` and derived `debtEncounterCards` state. Debt projections now map to `asset-guardian`, `interest-specter`, `principal-lock`, and `steady-path` encounter cards with support/warning/danger/neutral severity and safe Thai coaching copy. Wired cards into the read-only Debt Dungeon panel. Tests prove all pressure levels and no shame/apply/borrow/pay-now language; Playwright proved guardian/specter visible, 4 cards rendered, forbidden buttons=0, no overflow, and console 0 errors/0 warnings. Screenshot: `.playwright-cli/page-2026-06-04T23-33-55-114Z.png`. Verified 209 tests, typecheck/build, React Doctor 100, and production client scan clean. **RESUME** → 3.4.

### Ticket 3.4 — Debt Dungeon scene shell + entry bridge  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Add the lightest possible in-world scene/bridge for Debt Dungeon without changing debt data or adding real financial actions.
**Files**: Phaser scene/preload/entry bridge tests; optional reused local art only.
**Done when**:
- [x] A deterministic entry point can open the existing read-only Debt Dungeon panel from the game world
- [x] Scene/bridge has tests for input gating and no pay/apply/borrow side effects
- [x] Runtime smoke proves entry works, panel still read-only, and console is clean
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added a lightweight programmatic Debt Dungeon entry in FarmScene at a deterministic farm cell. The entry consumes pointer propagation and opens the existing read-only `debt-dungeon` modal; no debt data mutation or financial action was added. Scene test proves bridge behavior. Playwright proved a real canvas click on the portal opens Debt Dungeon, modal visible, forbidden buttons=0, and console 0 errors/0 warnings. Screenshot: `.playwright-cli/page-2026-06-04T23-37-30-720Z.png`. Verified 210 tests, typecheck/build, React Doctor 100, and production client scan clean. **RESUME** → 3.5.

### Ticket 3.5 — Debt Dungeon NPC coach canned lines  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Add deterministic canned coach lines for Debt Dungeon encounters without LLM calls or personalized financial advice.
**Files**: pure coach copy/data + tests; optional panel display after logic passes.
**Done when**:
- [x] Each encounter type has short Thai coaching text and a neutral learning prompt
- [x] Copy avoids shame, loan application language, and payment/order commands
- [x] Tests prove deterministic mapping and no external generation/API path
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added pure `buildDebtCoachLines`, derived `debtCoachLines` state, and a read-only coach section in the Debt Dungeon panel. Each encounter card now has deterministic Thai NPC coaching copy from `โค้ชดันเจี้ยน` plus neutral `ลองสังเกต...` prompts. Tests prove source projection mapping, no LLM/API/generation strings, and no apply/borrow/pay-now language. Playwright proved 4 coach lines rendered, prompt visible, forbidden buttons=0, no overflow, and console 0 errors/0 warnings. Screenshot: `.playwright-cli/page-2026-06-04T23-41-36-037Z.png`. Verified 211 tests, typecheck/build, React Doctor 100, and production client scan clean. **RESUME** → 3.6.

### Ticket 3.6 — Debt Dungeon mobile/tablet QA + Phase 3 closeout smoke  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Verify the complete Debt Dungeon flow across critical viewports and decide whether Phase 3 is shippable or needs polish tickets.
**Files**: runtime evidence, roadmap/HANDOFF/session-memory only unless QA exposes a bug.
**Done when**:
- [x] Desktop, iPhone-size, and iPad-size Debt Dungeon panel have no horizontal overflow
- [x] Farm portal click and HUD button both open the same read-only panel
- [x] Console clean, tests/build/React Doctor pass, and Phase 3 resume anchor moves to the next backlog
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Closed the Phase 3 Debt Dungeon slice with runtime QA. HUD button flow passed at desktop 1440×900, iPhone 390×844, and iPad 768×1024: heading/read-only copy visible, 4 coach lines rendered, forbidden buttons=0, and no horizontal overflow. Farm portal closeout smoke also passed via real canvas click: modal visible, `openModal=debt-dungeon`, forbidden buttons=0, and console 0 errors/0 warnings. Screenshots: `.playwright-cli/debt-dungeon-desktop-2026-06-05.png`, `.playwright-cli/debt-dungeon-iphone-2026-06-05.png`, `.playwright-cli/debt-dungeon-ipad-2026-06-05.png`, `.playwright-cli/debt-dungeon-portal-closeout-2026-06-05.png`. Latest verification remains 211 tests, typecheck/build, React Doctor 100, and production client scan clean. Phase 3 Debt Dungeon complete. **RESUME** → 4.1.

## Phase 4 — Sea + Tide & Tally Bridge

Promoted from the GDD after the Phase 3 Debt Dungeon slice completed. Keep this read-only and boundary-first: Sunday Invest Moon can point toward Tide & Tally/pirate ships, but must not import live trading, exchange keys, order actions, or shared mutable bot state into the client.

### Ticket 4.1 — Sea bridge read-only contract + Tide & Tally boundary  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Define the minimal type/logic contract for linking Sunday Invest Moon's farm/sea edge to Tide & Tally without crossing the mock-only/client-safety boundary.
**Files**: new pure bridge contract + tests; update GDD/HANDOFF if needed.
**Done when**:
- [x] Contract exposes read-only roster/route metadata only
- [x] Tests prove no exchange key, order, trade, or writable bot method exists
- [x] Copy clearly labels the sea bridge as a future/visual connection, not live trading
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added minimal Sea/Tide & Tally bridge contract: `SeaBridgeRoute`, visual roster metadata, safe seed data, `resolveSeaBridgeRoute`, and `describeSeaBridge`. Contract is read-only and labels the connection as a future visual link, not a live system. Tests prove route/roster metadata only and scan serialization for no exchange/key/order/trade/buy/sell copy. Verified 213 tests, typecheck/build, React Doctor 100, and targeted sea bridge boundary scan clean. **RESUME** → 4.2.

### Ticket 4.2 — Sea bridge store state + read-only panel  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Expose the Sea/Tide & Tally bridge metadata in app state and display a read-only panel without adding any live integration.
**Files**: `src/state/store.ts`, new panel/button or existing HUD routing + tests.
**Done when**:
- [x] Store derives a read-only sea bridge summary from static route/roster metadata
- [x] UI clearly says future visual link / read-only and has no action buttons beyond close
- [x] Tests prove no exchange key, order, trade, buy, sell, or writable method path
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added derived `seaBridge` state, read-only HUD button, and parchment-style Sea/Tide & Tally panel. Store tests prove cloned read-only route/roster metadata and no writable sea action path. HUD tests prove the panel opens and exposes no exchange/order/trade/buy/sell action button. Runtime smoke passed at 1440x900: heading visible, read-only copy count=2, forbidden buttons=0, no horizontal overflow, console 0 errors/0 warnings. Screenshot: `.playwright-cli/sea-bridge-panel-2026-06-05.png`. Verified 215 tests, typecheck/build, React Doctor 100, and targeted sea bridge boundary scan clean. **RESUME** -> 4.3.

### Ticket 4.3 — Sea bridge Farm edge marker + click bridge  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Add a deterministic in-world Farm sea-edge marker that opens the existing read-only Sea bridge panel without adding a live scene transition or shared mutable Tide & Tally state.
**Files**: `src/phaser/scenes/FarmScene.ts`, scene tests, maybe farm seed/constants.
**Done when**:
- [x] FarmScene renders a clear sea-edge/pier/boat marker at a deterministic farm position
- [x] Clicking the marker opens `sea-bridge` and consumes pointer propagation
- [x] Tests/runtime smoke prove no live Tide & Tally transition, no exchange/order/trade/buy/sell path, and clean console
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added a deterministic Farm sea-horizon `Sea Bridge` marker that opens the existing read-only `sea-bridge` modal and consumes pointer propagation. Scene regression test proves the marker behavior. Runtime smoke started Farm via the dev seam, clicked the real canvas marker, and confirmed `openModal=sea-bridge`, heading visible, forbidden buttons=0, no horizontal overflow, and console 0 errors/0 warnings. Screenshot: `.playwright-cli/sea-bridge-farm-marker-2026-06-05.png`. Verified 216 tests, typecheck/build, React Doctor 100, targeted sea bridge boundary scan clean, and no Tide scene transition path. **RESUME** -> 4.4.

### Ticket 4.4 — Sea bridge mobile/tablet QA + Phase 4 closeout smoke  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Close Phase 4 with responsive QA for HUD + Farm marker entry paths and record evidence before promoting the next backlog slice.
**Files**: no code expected unless QA finds a regression; update HANDOFF/session-memory/roadmap.
**Done when**:
- [x] Desktop, iPhone, and iPad HUD-button flows open the read-only Sea bridge panel with no overflow
- [x] Farm marker closeout smoke opens `sea-bridge`, has no forbidden action buttons, and console is clean
- [x] Phase 4 is summarized in HANDOFF/session-memory, then `RESUME HERE` is promoted to the next approved slice
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Phase 4 closeout QA passed. HUD button flow passed at desktop 1440x900, iPhone 390x844, and iPad 768x1024: heading visible, read-only copy count=2, forbidden buttons=0, no horizontal overflow. Farm marker closeout opened `sea-bridge`, heading visible, forbidden buttons=0, no overflow, and console 0 errors/0 warnings. Screenshots: `.playwright-cli/sea-bridge-desktop-2026-06-05.png`, `.playwright-cli/sea-bridge-iphone-2026-06-05.png`, `.playwright-cli/sea-bridge-ipad-2026-06-05.png`, `.playwright-cli/sea-bridge-marker-closeout-2026-06-05.png`. Current verification remains 216 tests, typecheck/build, React Doctor 100, targeted boundary scan clean. Promoted Phase 5 read-only feed backlog into atomic tickets. **RESUME** -> 5.1.

## Phase 5 — Read-only Feed + Packaging Gate

Promoted from `HANDOFF.md` historical Phase 5 backlog after Phase 4 Sea bridge closeout. Keep this strict: no API keys in the browser, no order/trade/write method in any client interface, and no live feed activation without an explicit compliance gate + feature flag.

### Ticket 5.1 — Read-only feed contract + compliance flag shell  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Define a read-only live-feed boundary that can be implemented later without weakening the existing mock-only client safety model.
**Files**: `src/adapters/portfolioFeed.ts`, tests, maybe env/flag helper; update docs if needed.
**Done when**:
- [x] `PortfolioFeed` remains write-free and has no order/trade/buy/sell method
- [x] A future live read-only feed factory is gated behind an explicit disabled-by-default flag/shell
- [x] Tests prove browser/client code contains no API key, secret, exchange order, or execution path
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added fail-closed live read-only feed shell in `portfolioFeed.ts`: `resolveLiveReadOnlyFeedFlags`, `liveReadOnlyFeedEnabled`, and `createLiveReadOnlyFeed`. It requires both `VITE_PWQ_LIVE_READ_ONLY_FEED` and `VITE_PWQ_COMPLIANCE_APPROVED`, defaults disabled, returns a disabled feed when not approved, and still throws `not implemented` when both flags are true because no backend compliance contract exists yet. Tests prove no action-method surface on the returned feed. Verified 219 tests, typecheck/build, React Doctor 100, secret/network scan clean; action-term scan only hits existing explanatory comment and regression-test regex. **RESUME** -> 5.2.

### Ticket 5.2 — Mock-default feed selector guard  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Add a small selector seam so the app continues to use the mock feed by default and cannot accidentally activate the live read-only shell without the explicit gate.
**Files**: `src/adapters/portfolioFeed.ts` or a small hook/helper, tests, maybe `useMockPortfolioFeed.ts` rename only if needed.
**Done when**:
- [x] Default feed selection returns `createMockPortfolioFeed` behavior and never calls the live shell by default
- [x] Flagged live selection still fails closed until the backend contract exists
- [x] Tests prove no API key, secret, order, trade, buy, sell, submit, or execute path is introduced
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added `createPortfolioFeed` selector and routed `useMockPortfolioFeed` through it. Default and one-flag env cases still use the mock feed; fully flagged live selection routes into the fail-closed live shell and throws `not implemented`. Removed the now-internal `createMockPortfolioFeed` export after React Doctor flagged unused public surface. Runtime smoke proved default app snapshot `source=mock`, net worth 14990, open modal null, and console 0 errors/0 warnings. Screenshot: `.playwright-cli/feed-selector-mock-default-2026-06-05.png`. Verified 221 tests, typecheck/build, React Doctor 100, secret/network scan clean; action-term scan only hits regression-test regex and existing explanatory comment. **RESUME** -> 5.3.

### Ticket 5.3 — Backend read-only feed contract doc + client-safety scan  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Document the future backend-only read feed contract and add/record a repeatable client-safety scan so future agents do not put provider/exchange keys in Vite/browser code.
**Files**: docs/protocol or A-Wiki ADR, maybe product HANDOFF; tests only if adding a script.
**Done when**:
- [x] Contract clearly says backend owns secrets/session/auth; Vite client receives read-only snapshots only
- [x] Contract explicitly forbids client API keys, exchange credentials, order/trade/write endpoints, and execution buttons
- [x] A repeatable scan command is documented or automated and passes
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added `docs/protocols/pwq-read-only-feed-contract.md` with backend-owned secret/session/auth requirements, client prohibitions, feature flag rules, and repeatable verification commands. Added product `tools/scan-feed-boundary.mjs`, `tools/scan-feed-boundary.test.mjs`, and `npm run feed:scan`; scanner strips comments to avoid Iron-Law false positives while flagging executable-looking secret/network/action code in production feed files. Verified `npm run feed:scan`, targeted scan tests, 223 full tests, typecheck/build, React Doctor 100, and regenerated A-Wiki index/check. **RESUME** -> 5.4.

### Ticket 5.4 — Packaging/preflight checklist for sale-ready mock build  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Create a small release/preflight checklist for a sellable mock-only build that preserves public-safe docs, build evidence, and no-live-feed/no-execution guarantees.
**Files**: product HANDOFF or A-Wiki runbook/protocol; no production code expected unless adding a verification script.
**Done when**:
- [x] Checklist covers build/test/typecheck/React Doctor/feed scan/privacy scan and screenshot evidence
- [x] Checklist says release artifact remains mock/read-only unless a separate backend contract is approved
- [x] `RESUME HERE` moves to the next concrete packaging or deploy ticket
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added `docs/runbooks/pwq-sale-ready-mock-build.md`, a release/preflight checklist for sellable mock/read-only artifacts. It covers `feed:scan`, tests, typecheck, build, React Doctor, runtime screenshots, A-Wiki roadmap sync, gen-index, sync tests, privacy scan, release-gate assertions, and fail-closed behavior. Verification: `npm run feed:scan` clean and targeted feed/scanner tests passed. `python3 scripts/check-privacy.py -v` currently fails on 12 codename findings across 4 pre-existing files (`sunday-estate-webapp`/`<repo-owner>` path/repo references), so release packaging is not public-safe yet. **RESUME** -> 5.5.

### Ticket 5.5 — Public-safe privacy cleanup for release preflight  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Resolve or document the current `check-privacy.py` codename findings so the sale-ready preflight can pass before any public artifact is shared.
**Files**: `game-assets/manifests/pixel-wealth-quest/README.md`, `scripts/game/normalize_pet_anims.py`, `scripts/game/normalize_pwq_anims.py`, `wiki/synthesis/pixel-wealth-quest-gdd.md`, and/or privacy allowlist if that is the correct policy.
**Done when**:
- [x] `python3 scripts/check-privacy.py -v` findings are reduced to zero or explicitly justified by a tracked allowlist/policy
- [x] Any path examples avoid private usernames, repo codenames, or personal GitHub identifiers in public-safe artifacts
- [x] Runbook/HANDOFF/session-memory record the final privacy status
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Resolved the 12 privacy codename findings without adding an allowlist. Scrubbed product repo/path examples to generic `sunday-estate-webapp` placeholders, removed personal owner/repo references from the GDD, and changed animation normalization scripts to discover a sibling `pixel-wealth-quest` directory generically instead of hardcoding the product repo codename. Verified `python3 scripts/check-privacy.py -v` clean, `python3 -m pytest tests/test_normalize_pwq_anims.py -v` 5 passed, and `python3 scripts/gen-index.py && python3 scripts/gen-index.py --check` green. **RESUME** -> 5.6.

### Ticket 5.6 — Full sale-ready preflight evidence bundle  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Run the full sale-ready mock-build preflight now that privacy is clean, and record the fresh evidence bundle in HANDOFF/session-memory.
**Files**: no production code expected unless checks expose a regression; update HANDOFF/roadmap/session-memory with evidence.
**Done when**:
- [x] Product checks pass: `feed:scan`, full tests, typecheck, build, React Doctor
- [x] A-Wiki checks pass: roadmap sync, gen-index/check, sync tests, privacy scan
- [x] Runtime screenshot evidence is fresh enough for the mock/read-only release checklist
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Full sale-ready mock preflight passed. Product: `npm run feed:scan` clean, 223 tests passed, typecheck/build passed, React Doctor 100/no issues. Runtime evidence captured title, room/mock portfolio (`source=mock`, net worth 14990), portfolio panel, Debt Dungeon, Sea Bridge, News Bird, and real Farm sea marker click; forbidden button counts were 0 for Debt/Sea/News/marker, Debt/Sea overflow false, marker opened `sea-bridge`, console 0 errors/0 warnings. Screenshots: `.playwright-cli/release-title-2026-06-05.png`, `.playwright-cli/release-room-mock-portfolio-2026-06-05.png`, `.playwright-cli/release-portfolio-panel-2026-06-05.png`, `.playwright-cli/release-debt-dungeon-2026-06-05.png`, `.playwright-cli/release-sea-bridge-2026-06-05.png`, `.playwright-cli/release-news-bird-2026-06-05.png`, `.playwright-cli/release-farm-sea-marker-2026-06-05.png`. A-Wiki: roadmap mirror matched, gen-index/check green, privacy scan clean, sync tests passed. **RESUME** -> 5.7.

### Ticket 5.7 — Prototype iframe integration smoke  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Verify the parent prototype can still open the PWQ iframe entry for a sale/demo flow without breaking the product app.
**Files**: parent prototype only if smoke exposes a regression; update HANDOFF/session-memory/roadmap.
**Done when**:
- [x] Parent prototype navigation entry opens Sunday Invest Moon/PWQ iframe in dev or configured preview
- [x] PWQ iframe renders title/start and mock/read-only app without console errors
- [x] Screenshot evidence is recorded, or a blocker is written with exact missing server/config
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Prototype iframe smoke passed after scoped parent fixes. Served `prototype/` with `python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory prototype` and used Playwright init override `window.SE_PWQ_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5173/"` because PWQ dev server was on 5173 while prototype default expects 5175. Fixed duplicate-key warning in `FallbackMap` by keying fallback pins with id+index. Fixed Driver.js onboarding by filtering missing target elements, fail-closing when no steps exist, and calling `setSteps(steps)` after `setConfig`; bumped `onboarding.js` cache buster to v14. Smoke: Super User login -> Sunday Invest Moon nav -> iframe src `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`, PWQ HUD visible (`มูลค่าพอร์ต`), console 0 errors / 1 expected Babel dev warning. Screenshot: `.playwright-cli/prototype-pwq-iframe-clean-2026-06-05.png`. **RESUME** -> 6.1.

## Phase 6 — Handoff Audit + Commit Prep

Promoted after the sale-ready mock/read-only preflight and prototype iframe smoke. This phase is administrative: inventory changed files, verify no running helper processes are left unexpectedly, and prepare an accurate handoff for the next agent. Do not commit unless the user explicitly asks.

### Ticket 6.1 — Changed-file inventory + final handoff audit  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Produce a precise changed-file inventory across A-Wiki and product/prototype repos so the next agent can continue or commit safely.
**Files**: no code expected; update HANDOFF/session-memory/roadmap only if the audit changes resume state.
**Done when**:
- [x] `git status --short` is captured for A-Wiki and the product repo
- [x] Any running dev/static helper servers are listed or stopped if no longer needed
- [x] Final RESUME HERE points to the next concrete task or clearly says the implementation slice is complete
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Captured final git/server audit. A-Wiki `git status --short` currently shows only tracked deletions of volatile pharmacy SQLite sidecars: `wiki/entities/pharmacy/drugs.db-shm` and `wiki/entities/pharmacy/drugs.db-wal`. Parent product repo shows modified prototype files (`index.html`, `src/maps.jsx`, `src/onboarding.js` plus older modified `app.jsx`, `data.jsx`, `shell.jsx`, `.claude/launch.json`) and large untracked `pixel-wealth-quest/`, `game/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/skills/`. Static prototype server on port 8000 was stopped; PWQ Vite dev server remains on `127.0.0.1:5173` (pre-existing server PID 76471). **RESUME** -> 6.2 only if the user explicitly asks for staging/commit/review.

### Ticket 6.2 — Optional stage/commit review (requires explicit user instruction)  · `[x]`
**Goal**: If and only if the user asks to commit, inspect the dirty tree carefully, stage only the intended files, and commit atomically per repo policy.
**Files**: no default edits.
**Done when**:
- [x] User explicitly asks for commit/stage/push, or this ticket remains pending
- [x] Intended files are separated from unrelated pre-existing changes before staging
- [x] Verification summary is included in commit message or handoff
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Review-only audit performed without staging/committing. A-Wiki was clean on `main...origin/main`; product parent repo had tracked prototype/config changes plus a large untracked `pixel-wealth-quest/` module. `pixel-wealth-quest/` had 1191 untracked entries, including source/assets/evidence plus generated dependency/build directories (`node_modules`, `dist`) that must be excluded or reviewed separately before any commit. This ticket remains `[ ]` because no explicit user stage/commit/push instruction was given.
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added A-Wiki readiness cleanup for SQLite sidecars discovered during continued review: `.gitignore` now ignores `*.db-shm` and `*.db-wal`, and `verify-awiki-ready.py` tests require those patterns. This keeps `gen-index`/pharmacy SQLite runtime files from polluting handoff status while leaving real DB policy unchanged.
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Added product-module `.gitignore` coverage for local Playwright/evidence outputs (`.playwright-cli/`, `output/`). `node_modules/` and `dist/` were already ignored. Future commit review should stage source/assets/docs intentionally and leave generated runtime evidence out unless explicitly requested.
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: User explicitly authorized stage/commit. Staged the Sunday Invest Moon product module plus parent prototype integration/smoke-fix files; intentionally left unrelated parent `.claude/launch.json`, `game/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.claude/skills/` out of the commit. Verification before staging: `npm run feed:scan`, `npm test -- --run` (223 passed), `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npx react-doctor@latest --verbose --diff` (100/100).

## Polish P1 — User Runtime Polish Goal (2026-06-05)

### Ticket P1.1 — Responsive/title/movement/living-room/farm first pass  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Address the user's runtime polish list before the larger PixelLab/Gemini asset generation pass.
**Done**:
- [x] Title splash switched to `public/assets/title/sunday-invest-moon-splash-v002.jpg` from a local Downloads reference image; original archived at `A-Wiki/game-assets/references/sunday-invest-moon/title/splash-v002.png`.
- [x] Title button moved higher so it does not overlap the `© 2006 Sunday Estate` footer area.
- [x] React HUD hidden on Title scene: no portfolio status, backpack, Worker-Bot, Debt, Sea, or control hint; only Phaser start button remains.
- [x] App shell hardened for responsive dynamic viewport with `100svh`/`100dvh`, full-size canvas, and no horizontal overflow in title runtime QA.
- [x] Living-room dogs are stationary by passing `wander:false` to `PetPack`; Farm dogs still wander.
- [x] Player action strip changed from Thai text chips to icon chips with the same accessible labels, translucent AssistiveTouch-like styling, and floating pop placement.
- [x] Run action no longer auto-runs randomly; it enables a temporary `วิ่ง x2` status chip and doubles click/keyboard movement speed.
- [x] Click-to-move path tween duration now scales by cell distance, so diagonal steps are not artificially fast.
- [x] Room keyboard movement supports Control as a run modifier; Farm grid movement supports Control/run status with run animation and 2x step duration.
- [x] Farm camera zooms in (`1.35`) and the house warp marker is smaller, lighter, and closer to the door instead of looking like a dark hole.
- [x] Added farm/shop/background/prop/season prompt pack: `pixel-wealth-quest/docs/asset-prompts/sunday-invest-moon-farm-prompts.md`.
**Still open / closed by follow-up**:
- [x] PixelLab/Gemini asset batch for title flowers/tree wind/Nong Sunday lying sky pose/3 dogs wagging title pose.
- [x] PixelLab farm prop batch: big tree, bushes, flowers, log, rock, cloud, water current, dirt path, plus more Harvest-Moon-style decorations.
- [x] Seasonal system: random season changes every 5 real minutes with generated/tinted animation assets.
- [x] News Bird upgrade: flapping-wing bird fly-by, dropped newspaper object, click newspaper on ground opens briefing.
- [x] TV One Piece-style animation final visual render/click-target QA.
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Implemented P1.1 first pass test-first where practical. Product checks so far: 229 tests passed, typecheck passed, build passed before final hit-zone propagation patch; rerun full verification before commit. Browser QA proved Title HUD removal, icon action strip, run status/no-auto-run, stationary living-room dogs, and blank canvas clicks no longer open player actions after hit-zone clamp. **RESUME** -> P1.2.

### Ticket P1.2 — PixelLab/Gemini farm/title animation asset batch  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Generate/import the actual art assets requested by the user and wire cheap Phaser animation loops.
**Files likely touched**:
- `public/assets/title/ambient/`
- `public/assets/farm/decor/`
- `src/phaser/scenes/TitleScene.ts`
- `src/phaser/scenes/FarmScene.ts`
- `src/phaser/scenes/PreloadScene.ts`
- `docs/asset-prompts/sunday-invest-moon-farm-prompts.md`
**Done when**:
- [x] PixelLab balance captured before/after.
- [x] Title page has animated flowers/trees, lying-smiling/blinking Nong Sunday, and 3 stationary tail-wag dogs matching the original title art style.
- [x] Farm map has reusable animated decor assets and a clear shop/background art plan or first implementation.
- [x] Runtime screenshots and tests/typecheck/build are recorded.
> 2026-06-06 codex-poppy-javis: Closed P1.2 by validating the existing generated asset batch and wiring already present in code. PixelLab balance before/after stayed `$3.47672558737464` because no new generation was needed this pass. Title runtime screenshot verified splash v002, flowers/tree, Nong Sunday title pose, and three stationary wagging dogs with console 0 errors/0 warnings: `pixel-wealth-quest/.playwright-cli/page-2026-06-06T03-00-52-415Z.png`. Farm runtime screenshots verified animated/reusable decor, water/path/tree view, farm shop/background view, season tint, and console clean: `page-2026-06-06T03-04-11-784Z.png`, `page-2026-06-06T03-04-41-213Z.png`. Product verification passed: `npm run feed:scan`, `npm test -- --run` (232 passed before TV hardening; targeted TV/decor test 8 passed after patch), `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npx react-doctor@latest --verbose --diff` (100/100). Added TV hardening in `RoomScene.playTvCartoon()` (depth 12000, readable title text, batch-local cleanup), but TV visual screenshot remains unresolved and is split to P1.3. **RESUME** -> P1.3 TV cartoon visual render/click-target QA.

### Ticket P1.3 — TV cartoon visual render/click-target QA  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Make the living-room TV cartoon visibly render on the baked TV screen and prove the normal click target opens it without using a dev hook.
**Files likely touched**:
- `src/phaser/scenes/RoomScene.ts`
- `src/phaser/playerMovementScenes.test.ts`
- optional room hotspot calibration in `src/data/room.seed.ts`
**Done when**:
- [x] A real browser screenshot shows the One Piece-style TV overlay visibly on the living-room TV.
- [x] A normal canvas click on the TV hotspot triggers the overlay; dev-hook invocation is not the only proof.
- [x] Console remains 0 errors/0 warnings.
- [x] Targeted test plus full product checks pass.
> 2026-06-06 codex-poppy-javis: Closed P1.3. Atomic Playwright normal canvas click at the runtime TV hotspot created 7 TV cartoon objects and captured visible overlay on the living-room TV: `pixel-wealth-quest/.playwright-cli/tv-normal-click-atomic-2026-06-06.png`. Console after the normal-click proof stayed 0 errors / 0 warnings. Product verification after the TV hardening patch passed: `npm run feed:scan`, `npm test -- --run` (233 passed), `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and React Doctor 100/100. No implementation ticket remains after P1.3; next action is optional stage/commit review only if the user explicitly asks.
> 2026-06-12 codex-poppy-javis: Re-verified the user runtime polish goal in the real product workspace path `<product-workspace>/pixel-wealth-quest`. Fixed a title-label regression so the fresh-save button is `เริ่มเกมส์` again, then runtime-verified the current browser at `127.0.0.1:5173`: title HUD remains hidden, existing-save title buttons sit above the footer, living-room dogs are stationary, and a normal TV click visibly renders the `ONE PIECE` TV overlay with console 0 errors / 0 warnings. During full verification, repaired Phase 12/13 state-contract drift: `friendship` is now declared/persisted in `PwqState`/`PwqInit`, NPC actions are typed, animal feeding tests now seed/consume `animal-feed`, and animal category labels are present in Shop/Inventory. Verification passed: targeted title/TV/state/component tests 46/46, full `npm test -- --run` 495/495, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npx react-doctor@latest --verbose --diff` 100/100. `npm run feed:scan` was not rerun in this pass because the approval request was rejected by the user/session.

## Phase 7 + 8 — Retro note (shipped outside roadmap tracking)

> [verified 2026-06-11] Phase 7 and Phase 8 were implemented and committed straight to product-repo main without roadmap sections (tracked via session goals). Cold-start summary:
> - **Phase 7 — Save System v2** (`0965b0d`): versioned `sim:save` single-key persistence, sleep-ready, forward-compatible (unknown fields extend the file without a version bump). Core: `src/logic/saveGame.ts` + store `SAVEABLE_FIELDS` funnel.
> - **Phase 8 — Farm life-sim core** (`03b036a`, `a5e5688`, `8fcbe3d`): multi-crop registry (`src/data/crops.seed.ts`), day-based growth, 4×28 calendar (`src/logic/calendar.ts`), deterministic FNV-1a weather (`src/logic/weather.ts`), energy system (`src/logic/energy.ts`), bed sleep flow + morning report UI, shipping-bin economy (`src/logic/shippingBin.ts` — ship produce, pay at sleep).
> - Test base after Phase 8: **300 vitest tests** green; bot trading still mock-only per ADR 2c.9.5.

---

## Phase 9 — Market economy + Bot seam hardening + HM UI + PixelLab animation batch

> Plan approved 2026-06-11 (claude-fable-5). Execution order: **9.0 → 9.1 → 9.2 → 9.3 → 9.9 → 9.10 → 9.11 → 9.12 → 9.4 → 9.5 → 9.6 → 9.7 → 9.8 → 9.13** (market logic first; PixelLab gen mid-phase so API risk surfaces early; bot seam after; UI polish last). Commit format `chunk(9.X): goal [next: 9.Y]`. PixelLab budget for the whole phase ≤ **$3.00** (player $1.00 + pets $2.00), balance echo before/after every gen ticket.

### Ticket 9.0 — Roadmap: Phase 7/8 retro + Phase 9 section + sync  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Canonical roadmap carries Phase 7/8 retro + this Phase 9 plan; mirror synced; RESUME HERE → 9.1.
**Done when**: sync script verifies no drift; both repos committed.

### Ticket 9.1 — `src/logic/market.ts` pure deterministic price engine  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Sell prices move daily without RNG state: `sellPriceOf(itemId, day, seed='pwq-market')` = `max(1, round(base × seasonal × drift × weatherMod))`.
- Drift = FNV-1a `hash(seed:itemId:day)` → **[0.85, 1.15]** (reuse `weather.ts` hash pattern; save-compatible, no stored state).
- Seasonal: in-season 1.0 / off-season 1.2 scarcity premium (per-produce table; default 1.0). WeatherMod: storm day ×1.05 (derived from `weatherFor`).
- Only produce moves; non-produce passes through static `priceCoins`. Shop buy prices stay static.
- `marketHistory(itemId, day, n=7)` = pure recompute → free sparkline.
**Files**: `src/logic/market.ts` (new), `src/logic/market.test.ts` (new).
**Test-first**: determinism; integer ≥1 bounds; non-produce passthrough; off-season > in-season same-day; history 7 points pointwise == `sellPriceOf`; storm modifier on a known storm day.
**Done when**: vitest + typecheck green; zero store/React imports.

### Ticket 9.2 — Wire market into settlement + bin preview  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Bin settles at the finished day's market price; `ShippingBinPanel` preview == morning payout **by construction**.
**Files**: `src/logic/sleep.ts` (swap local `priceOf` at line ~46 → `sellPriceOf(id, finishedDay)`), `src/logic/sleep.test.ts`, `src/components/ShippingBinPanel.tsx` (same swap at line ~7, using `gameClock.day`), panel + store tests.
**Test-first**: bin of 1 carrot on a drift≠1.0 day pays `sellPriceOf('carrot-produce', finishedDay)`, not 24; dedicated preview==payout invariant test (lock against future next-day-price refactors).
**Done when**: all tests green.

### Ticket 9.3 — `MarketPanel.tsx` UI  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Player sees today's prices: row per produce — today vs base, ▲/▼ arrow, 7-day inline-SVG sparkline (idiom from `BotStatusOverlay`).
**Entry**: "ราคาตลาดวันนี้" button in `ShippingBinPanel` header (no new art).
**Files**: `src/components/MarketPanel.tsx` (new + test), `src/state/store.ts` (`ModalName` + `'market'`), `HudOverlay.tsx`, `ShippingBinPanel.tsx`, `src/styles/hud.css`.
**Test-first**: one row per produce; arrow direction matches `sellPriceOf` vs base; sparkline has 7 points from `marketHistory`.
**Done when**: opens from bin panel; mobile-safe; tests + typecheck green.

### Ticket 9.4 — Bot config persistence in `sim:save`  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Bot configs survive reload; status recomputed deterministically on hydrate (equity curves NEVER persisted).
**Files**: `src/logic/saveGame.ts` (`botConfigs` field + sanitizer), `src/state/store.ts` (`SAVEABLE_FIELDS`, `hydrateBotConfigs` validating `strategyId`, `refreshBots()` on mount, `configureBot` writes `botConfigs`), tests.
**Test-first**: save round-trip with corrupt entry dropped; hydrate + `refreshBots()` curve == fresh `MockBotFeed` run (determinism proof).
**Done when**: reload restores configs; `npm run feed:scan` clean; mock-only invariant untouched.

### Ticket 9.5 — Daily bot refresh via `epoch` + serializable DTO guard  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Bot sparklines evolve once per in-game day, deterministically — no timers, no polling.
**Files**: `src/feeds/tradingBotFeed.ts` (`BotConfig.epoch?: number`; mock seed → `deviceId:strategyId:epoch??0`), `src/state/store.ts` (`sleep()` re-runs configured bots with epoch = new day), tests.
**Test-first**: same epoch → identical curve; different epoch → different; `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(status))` deep-equals status.
**Done when**: refresh is sleep-cadenced; all green.

### Ticket 9.6 — Versioned remote bot contract doc v1  · `[x]`
**Goal**: `docs/bot-feed-contract.md` v1 — `GET/PUT /api/sim/bots/:deviceId`, BotConfig/BotStatus JSON shapes (incl. optional `epoch`, remote may ignore), error model, explicit no-secrets/no-order-execution clauses; cross-link ADR 2c.9.5 + Phase 5 feed contract.
**Test-first**: regression lock — `RemoteBotFeed` still throws for both methods; no `fetch(`/URL literals in `tradingBotFeed.ts`.
**Done when**: doc versioned v1; feed:scan clean.

### Ticket 9.7 — HM HUD chip: season + weather + day  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Top chip shows season glyph + weather glyph + "วันที่ X" in HM idiom (inline pixel SVG, `--sim-*` tokens); data already in store.
**Files**: `HudOverlay.tsx` (+ test, possibly small `CalendarChip.tsx`), `hud.css`.
**Test-first**: aria-labels derived from `weatherFor(day, seasonOf(day))` + `dayOfSeason`.
**Done when**: desktop + 380px mobile no overflow; tests green.

### Ticket 9.8 — HM panel idiom pass (CSS-only)  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Consistent wood-frame header + parchment body + close-button placement across the ~15 modals.
**Files**: `src/styles/hud.css`, `tokens.css` only.
**Done when**: no component-markup changes beyond classNames; existing tests + typecheck green; visual QA 3 representative panels desktop/mobile.

### Ticket 9.9 — PixelLab gen: player tool anims (water/hoe/harvest, south)  · `[x]`
**Goal**: 3 new south-facing 7-frame one-shots for น้องซันเดย์ (`watering`, `hoeing`, `harvest` scythe swing), normalized into `playerAnims.ts`.
**Process**: `pixellab_gen.py balance` echo before → kick 3 `pixellab_character.py animate --character-id 58be20a8-ee08-4432-bb43-3627f69e12ac` jobs at session start → write failing `playerAnims.test.ts` while polling → zip export → extend `ACTION_MAP/ACTION_ORDER/FRAME_RATE` in A-Wiki `scripts/game/normalize_pwq_anims.py` → re-run normalize → balance echo after. Pin the action slug in the prompt so the export filename matches `ACTION_MAP`.
**Budget**: cap **$1.00**, hard stop; log delta below.
**Done when**: 3 actions in manifest with 7 on-disk frames each; tests green.

### Ticket 9.10 — Wire tool anims into ToolWheel flow  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Selecting hoe/water/scythe plays the matching one-shot; farm logic stays instant (anim cosmetic).
**Files**: `src/phaser/toolAnimMap.ts` (new pure map: `hoe→hoe, water→water, scythe→harvest, seed→undefined`) + test, `playerController.ts` (expose `playOneShot(action)`), `FarmScene.ts` (`handleFarmTool` calls it), controller tests.
**Done when**: runtime QA shows swing before result; no energy/logic regressions.

### Ticket 9.11 — PixelLab gen: pet anims (run×8dir + eat/sleep/bark south)  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Per dog — red/สุขใจ, black/ศรีสุข, cream/มั่งมี (still renders in-game): 8-dir `run` + south one-shots `eat`, `sleep`, `bark`.
**Character ids** (from `public/assets/character/pets/gen/<c>/dog-<c>.character.json`): red `d09a749e-fce0-4ff6-8575-2a7e8f4884a2`, black `d43685ba-ea5d-4d94-9e35-2d79a2c95b18`, cream `bd9fd4e3-78b5-4f08-84cf-f426baae6fee` — reuse, no create step.
**Files**: A-Wiki `scripts/game/normalize_pet_anims.py` (extend literal `["walk","sit","wag"]`; `run` joins move actions + LOOPING), pet `anim_clean/`, regenerated `petAnims.ts`, tests.
**Test-first**: `PET_ANIM_ACTIONS` includes eat/sleep/bark; `PET_MOVE_ACTIONS` includes run; frames on disk for all 3 dogs.
**Budget**: cap **$2.00** total, 2 gates (gate A = 3 run jobs, gate B = 9 one-shots); over cap → drop `bark` first.
**Done when**: manifest regenerated; balance + evidence logged.

### Ticket 9.12 — Pet behaviors: idle scheduler + bark-on-click  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Dogs occasionally eat/sleep during wander; rare run burst; clicking a dog plays bark and still opens the bio panel.
**Files**: `src/phaser/objects/PetPack.ts` (tick choice table + one-shot playback, injectable rng), tests, pet click bridge (bark then existing `gameBus.emit('pet-clicked')`).
**Test-first**: seeded rng tick sequence includes an `eat` one-shot then resumes wander; click still emits `pet-clicked` (bio regression lock); missing anim key → graceful skip, no crash.
**Done when**: runtime QA in Room + Farm; tests green.

### Ticket 9.13 — Phase 9 closeout smoke + roadmap sync  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Full runtime smoke — market panel → ship → sleep → payout == preview → bot refresh → tool anim → pet behaviors; desktop + mobile; console clean.
**Gate**: `npm test` (all) + `npm run typecheck` + `npm run feed:scan` + React Doctor; canonical roadmap updated → mirror synced → closing commit.
> 2026-06-14 claude-sonnet-4-6: Phase 9 fully closed — 9.4 bot persist + refreshBots (4 tests), 9.5 epoch-keyed curves + DTO guard (5 tests), 9.6 bot contract doc v1, 9.7 CalendarChip HUD (6 tests), 9.8 wood-frame panel CSS, 9.12 pet idle behaviors eat/sleep/bark (6 tests), 9.13 closeout. Final: **614/614 vitest, typecheck clean, feed:scan clean**. Added @types/node + fixed hud-readability.test.ts (node:fs). **RESUME** → Phase 9b retro / Phase 16 plan.

## Phase 9b — Plan Phase 9–11 retro: Market Feed Seam + Paper Engine + Backtest UI

> [verified 2026-06-12] Market feed seam, paper trading engine, and backtest UI were implemented in a single session (product commits 260e281, 8fdfaa7, f47726a + Phase 10–11 commits). These correspond to the approved plan's Phase 9–11 (plan approved 2026-06-11). Test base after this work: **422 vitest tests** green, typecheck clean, `npm run feed:scan` clean.

### Plan Phase 9 — Market Data Backend + Feed Seam  · `[x]`
> [verified 2026-06-12]
> - `backend/routers/market.py`: GET /api/market/klines + /symbols, Binance→OKX fallback, TTL cache, allowlist, rate limit
> - `backend/tests/test_market.py`: 7 pytest tests (mock httpx, cache, allowlist, 502)

> - `tools/capture-canned-candles.mjs`: author-time refresh script
> - `src/feeds/marketDataFeed.ts`: `MarketDataFeed` interface (read-only, no order methods); `CannedMarketDataFeed` default; `RemoteMarketDataFeed` flag-gated (`VITE_PWQ_MARKET_FEED=remote`, fails loudly)
> - `src/feeds/marketDataFeed.test.ts`: 9 contract tests (assertReadOnly, allowlist, timestamps)
> - `A-Wiki/docs/protocols/bot-trading-iron-law.md`: amended to approve paper trading on public keyless data; 7 client prohibitions unchanged

### Plan Phase 10 — Paper Trading Engine + Presets + Settlement  · `[x]`
> [verified 2026-06-12]
> - `src/logic/indicators.ts`: SMA/EMA/RSI(Wilder)/MACD/Bollinger/ATR/highest/lowest/crossAbove/crossBelow — pure, 27 golden-value tests
> - `src/types/strategy.ts`: `StrategyDef` JSON schema — engine: signal/grid/dca/rebalance, RuleGroups, RiskParams
> - `src/data/strategyPresets.ts`: 10 presets (grid-classic, grid-wide, dca-steady, dca-martingale, rebalance-5050, ma-cross, rsi-reversal, macd-momentum, bollinger-meanrev, breakout-high) + `LEGACY_STRATEGY_ALIAS` for save compat
> - `src/logic/paperBroker.ts`: fee=0.1%, slippage=5bps, fill tracking, maxDrawdown, winRate
> - `src/logic/strategyEngine.ts`: `runStrategy(def, candles, startCash)` — single function for live bot + backtest

## Resource Note: Real Broker Adapter (Future Phase)

> **Cost-first**: ก่อนเริ่ม phase นี้ scout free model tier ก่อน; backend Python เท่านั้น; client ห้ามแตะ broker เด็ดขาด (Iron Law)

**iqoptionapi** (community, unofficial): https://github.com/iqoptionapi/iqoptionapi

### ช่วยลดเวลาได้ที่ Broker Adapter layer เท่านั้น
| สิ่งที่ iqoptionapi มีให้ | ประโยชน์ |
|--------------------------|----------|
| `connect()` / `connect_2fa()` / `check_connect()` | Login + reconnect + 2FA พร้อมใช้ ไม่ต้อง reverse-engineer WebSocket |
| `get_candles(asset, ...)` | ดึง candle จาก IQ Option ได้ทันที |
| `get_all_open_time()` | เช็ค asset เปิด/ปิด (forex/cfd/crypto/digital/binary) |
| `buy()` / `buy_digital_spot_v2()` / `buy_order()` | ส่ง order หลายประเภท |
| `get_order()` / `get_positions()` / `get_position_history_v2()` | ติดตาม position |
| `get_digital_payout()` / `get_all_profit()` | payout/profit data |

> ลด prototype broker adapter: reverse-engineer WebSocket (หลายวัน) --> prototype ใน 1-2 วัน
> **Warning**: unofficial/community repo -- มี timeout/check-win issues; ใช้เป็น learning/prototype เท่านั้น

### สิ่งที่ iqoptionapi ไม่ช่วยแทน (ต้องสร้างเอง)
strategy engine, backtesting, risk manager, portfolio/accounting, order reconciliation, monitoring/alert, database schema, dashboard, test suite, live/paper parity

### Architecture ที่แนะนำ (backend-only -- Iron Law คงเดิม)

Client เห็นแค่ paper trade result เสมอ -- ไม่มี order path ใน browser เด็ดขาด

```python
# Abstract interface -- เขียนก่อน, adapter มาทีหลัง
class BrokerAdapter:
    def get_candles(self, symbol, interval, limit): ...
    def place_order(self, symbol, direction, amount): ...
    def get_order(self, order_id): ...
    def get_positions(self): ...
    def close_position(self, position_id): ...

# Concrete adapters
class IqOptionAdapter(BrokerAdapter): ...   # <- iqoptionapi wraps here
class AlpacaAdapter(BrokerAdapter):   ...   # future
class BinanceAdapter(BrokerAdapter):  ...   # future
```

```
[ Execution Engine (backend) ]
        |
[ BrokerAdapter interface ]
        |
[ IqOptionAdapter ]  [ AlpacaAdapter ]  [ BinanceAdapter ]
        |
[ iqoptionapi ]
```

**Phase ที่ใช้ประโยชน์**: future Phase X3 (Real Broker Integration) -- หลัง Phase 14, ยังไม่อยู่ใน scope ปัจจุบัน; ใส่ไว้เพื่อ reference เมื่อถึงเวลา

## Phase 12 — NPCs

> Plan approved 2026-06-11. 3 NPCs: แม่ค้าตลาด / ลุงชาวประมง / ครูการเงิน. Schedule-driven, gift/talk friendship points. Commit format `chunk(12.X): goal [next: 12.Y]`.

### Ticket 12.1 -- npcs.seed.ts NPC registry  . [x]
**Goal**: 3 NPCs with typed bios, gift preferences, and daily schedule slots.
**New file**: `src/data/npcs.seed.ts`
```ts
NpcId = 'market-lady' | 'fishing-uncle' | 'finance-teacher'
NpcDef = { id, nameTh, schedule: NpcSlot[], giftPrefs: { loved, liked, disliked }, portraitPath }
NpcSlot = { fromMin, toMin, sceneId: 'town' | 'farm' | 'room', cell: Cell }
```
**New test**: compile + type check; every NPC has ≥3 schedule slots; no loved/liked overlap; portrait paths are strings.
**Done when**:
- [x] File exports typed NPC_DEFS record
- [x] Tests green
> 2026-06-12 claude-sonnet-4-6: 12.1 done -- npcs.seed.ts (3 NPCs: market-lady/fishing-uncle/finance-teacher), npcSchedule.ts locationAt(), 7+4 tests green. RESUME HERE -> 12.2.

### Ticket 12.2 -- npcSchedule.ts + friendship.ts  . [x]
**Goal**: Pure location resolver + pure friendship point tracker.
**New files**:
- `npcSchedule.ts`: `locationAt(npc: NpcDef, minuteOfDay: number): NpcSlot`
- `friendship.ts`: 0–1000 points → 10 hearts; `giveGift(state, npc, item) → delta`; loved +80 / liked +30 / disliked −20; once per day guard; `talk(state, npc) → delta` +10
**Test-first**: schedule wraps correctly; gift deltas match pref table; once-per-day guard; heart level = floor(points/100).
**Done when**: tests + typecheck green; zero React/store imports.
> 2026-06-12 claude-sonnet-4-6: 12.2 done -- npcSchedule.ts + friendship.ts (initFriendship/giveGift/talkToNpc/heartLevel/friendshipDiscount), 16 tests green; zero React/Zustand imports. RESUME HERE -> 12.3.

### Ticket 12.3 -- dialogue.seed.ts + DialoguePanel.tsx  . [x]
**Goal**: Canned dialogue indexed by (npcId, heartLevel 0|1|2|3+) — coaching/friendly only, no trade execution language.
**New files**: `dialogue.seed.ts` (entries per NPC × 4 heart tiers), `DialoguePanel.tsx` (parchment modal, portrait, lines, close + optional gift button when inventory has a liked item).
**Safety scan**: no `ซื้อ/ขาย/ส่งออเดอร์/เทรด` in dialogue seed.
**Done when**:
- [x] Safety scan clean
- [x] Tests prove no execution language; panel renders portrait + lines
> 2026-06-12 claude-sonnet-4-6: 12.3 done -- dialogue.seed.ts (4 tiers/NPC, Thai, safety scan clean); DialoguePanel.tsx (portrait/hearts/tier-lines/talk/close); HudOverlay wired; 5+6 tests green. RESUME HERE -> 12.4.

### Ticket 12.4 — NPC rendering in `FarmScene.ts` + click bridge  · `[x]`
**Goal**: NPCs visible in FarmScene at schedule-determined positions; click opens dialogue.
**Edit**: `FarmScene.ts` — on each game-tick, call `locationAt(npc, minuteOfDay)` for each NPC; render/move sprite (reuse `PetPack` wander tween pattern, but position-based not random); interactive zone → `gameBus.emit('npc-clicked', npcId)`.
**Edit**: `HudOverlay.tsx` — render `DialoguePanel` when `openModal === 'npc:*'`.
**Preload**: placeholder NPC sprites (reuse existing walking human Worker-Bot sprites until PixelLab batch).
**Done when**:
- [x] NPC appears at correct farm cell per schedule
- [x] Click → dialogue panel; propagation consumed
- [x] Tests green; typecheck green
> 2026-06-12 claude-sonnet-4-6: 12.4 done -- FarmScene.redrawNpcs() renders 3 NPCs at locationAt() positions; gameBus 'npc-click' event + HudOverlay listener → openNpcDialogue; 22 NPC tests pass. RESUME HERE -> 12.5.

### Ticket 12.5 — Friendship unlocks (shop discount)  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Hearts ≥ 3 → 5% shop discount; hearts ≥ 6 → 10%.
**Edit**: `src/state/store.ts` — `friendshipDiscount(npcId): number` derived selector; `ShopPanel.tsx` reads it; `buy()` applies.
**Test-first**: discount = max across all NPCs; discount correctly reduces price; tests green.
> 2026-06-12 claude-sonnet-4-6: 12.5 done -- ShopPanel shows strikethrough+discounted price + badge "ลด X%"; buy aria-label uses finalPrice; 6 ShopPanel tests (inc. 4 discount); 469/469 tests. RESUME HERE -> 12.6.

### Ticket 12.6 — PixelLab NPC sprites + Phase 12 smoke  · `[x]`
**Goal**: 3 NPCs × 4-dir walk + idle south (cap $1.20).
**Process**: echo balance before/after; 3 PixelLab `animate` jobs; normalize + wire into PreloadScene.
**Done when**:
- [x] Sprites on-disk; manifest entries; runtime smoke desktop + mobile; console 0 errors
> 2026-06-13 codex-poppy-javis: 12.6 done -- PixelLab create-character + animate generated 3 NPCs with idle south + 4-dir walk frames (9 frames/dir), normalized into `public/assets/character/npcs/`, added `npc-sprites.manifest.json`, wired `preloadNpcFrames()` into PreloadScene, and replaced Worker-Bot placeholder texture keys. Balance before `$2.96099750654565`, after NPC batch `$2.77687443613344` (spend ~$0.1841 < $1.20 cap). Verified 504 tests, typecheck/build/feed scan, React Doctor 100, desktop/mobile runtime asset smoke.

## Phase 13 — Farm Animals

> Plan approved 2026-06-11. Chicken + cow, daily feed → happiness → produce quality.

### Ticket 13.1 — `src/data/animals.seed.ts` + `src/logic/animals.ts`  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Animal registry + pure daily happiness + produce quality logic.
**New files**: `animals.seed.ts` (AnimalDef: id, nameTh, feedItemId, producesId, spriteKey), `animals.ts` (pure: `feedAnimal`, `animalDayTick` → happiness ±, `produceQuality(happiness)`).
**New items in `items.ts`**: `animal-feed`, `egg`, `milk` (3 quality tiers each).
**Test-first**: missed feed → happiness −10; daily produce qty × quality deterministic.
> 2026-06-13 codex-poppy-javis: Verified current implementation -- chicken/cow registry, animal-feed, egg/milk quality tiers, and pure animal logic covered by animals/items tests.

### Ticket 13.2 — Store + barn zone + `animalDayTick` hook  · `[x]`
**Files**: `store.ts` (`animals[]`, `feedAnimal`, `animalDayTick` called from `sleep()`), `farm.seed.ts` (add `barn` zone cells near bottom of farm grid).
> 2026-06-13 codex-poppy-javis: Verified current store integration -- animals persist, feed consumes animal-feed, sleep ticks happiness/produce, and barn zone exists in FARM.zones.

### Ticket 13.3 — `FarmScene.ts` render + `AnimalPanel.tsx`  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Animals wander in barn zone (reuse `PetPack` wander); click opens status/feed panel.
**Done when**: feed button reduces animal-feed inventory; next-day produce in shipping bin.
> 2026-06-13 codex-poppy-javis: Added AnimalPanel, gameBus animal-clicked bridge, FarmScene.redrawAnimals() in barn zone, and placeholder chicken/cow textures. Targeted animal/HUD/preload tests 53 passed; typecheck green.

### Ticket 13.4 — PixelLab chicken + cow sprites + smoke  · `[x]`
**Budget**: cap $0.90; echo balance before/after; normalize + wire.
> 2026-06-13 codex-poppy-javis: 13.4 done -- Generated PixelLab `chicken-v001.png` + `cow-v001.png`, added `spritePath` registry fields, preloaded both real animal textures, and guarded placeholder generation so loaded textures are not overwritten. Animal batch spend ~$0.0148; balance after `$2.7620752804478` (< $0.90 cap). Desktop/mobile runtime smoke loaded NPC/animal assets with missing=0 and console/network issues=0.

---

## Phase 14 — Town + Market Prices + Festivals

> Plan approved 2026-06-11. TownScene, market stall, 2 festivals.

### Ticket 14.1 — `TownScene.ts` + `town.seed.ts`  · `[x]`
**Goal**: New Phaser scene (~24×16, top-down); market stall, town hall, farm→town east edge warp.
**Files**: `src/phaser/scenes/TownScene.ts`, `src/data/town.seed.ts`.
**Done when**: player can walk Farm east edge → TownScene and back; no asset budget yet.
**Delivered 2026-06-13**: test-first town seed + TownScene shell, Farm east-edge → Town warp, Town west gate → Farm return, Phaser registry coverage, runtime Town screenshot smoke.
**Verified**: 510 vitest tests; typecheck; build; feed scan; React Doctor 100/100; runtime smoke `/tmp/pwq-town-smoke.png`.

### Ticket 14.2 — `src/logic/marketPrices.ts` + `MarketStallPanel.tsx`  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Produce prices fluctuate daily deterministic (seasonal × seeded random walk 0.7–1.4); town market offers better rate than shipping bin on good days; optional remote mode: % change proportional to BTC-yesterday delta.
**Test-first**: determinism; market price > base some days < other days; town > bin invariant holds.
**Delivered 2026-06-13**: test-first deterministic `marketPrices.ts`, produce quote rows in `MarketStallPanel`, `sellAtTownMarket()` store action that pays coins immediately without touching the shipping bin, and TownScene market-stall bridge.
**Verified**: 523 vitest tests; typecheck; build; feed scan; React Doctor 100/100; runtime smoke `/tmp/pwq-market-stall-smoke.png`.

### Ticket 14.3 — `src/logic/festivals.ts` + 2 events  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Spring day 14 = produce contest (bonus coins for top-quality crop); Autumn day 14 = investment quiz (multiple-choice coaching question, coin reward).
**Test-first**: deterministic trigger; quiz answer validation; no financial advice copy.
**Delivered 2026-06-13**: test-first `festivals.ts` with Spring day 14 produce contest + Fall day 14 quiz, session-only quiz repeat guard, `FestivalPanel`, festival HUD button, and store actions for contest/quiz rewards.
**Verified**: 535 vitest tests; typecheck; build; feed scan; React Doctor 100/100; runtime smoke `/tmp/pwq-festival-smoke.png`.

### Ticket 14.4 — PixelLab town/festival assets + smoke  · `[x]`
**Budget**: cap $0.80; echo balance before/after.
> 2026-06-14 claude-sonnet-4-6: 14.4 done — town-market-stall-v001.png + town-hall-v001.png + festival-banner-v001.png generated (PixelLab, $0.0213); TownBuilding.textureKey/texturePath fields added; PreloadScene loops TOWN.buildings to load sprites; TownScene.drawBuildings() uses image sprite with rectangle fallback; town.assets.test.ts (3 tests) all pass. 617/617 tests, typecheck clean, feed:scan clean.

## Phase 15 — Analyst Desk (investneet-style readable analysis suite)

> Plan approved 2026-06-13. User loves **investneet.com/scan.html** — its readability, warm color tone, dashboard, charts, stock-scan radar, funds (กองทุน), stock descriptions, market analysis. Phase 15 brings that *readable* feel in as a clean **"Analyst Desk"** surface, reusing the Phase 9–11 market/indicator/paper-trading infra. **Backlog phase — begins after the current RESUME ticket; internal start = 15.1.** Commit `chunk(15.X): goal [next: 15.Y]`.
>
> **Iron Law (unchanged — see `docs/protocols/bot-trading-iron-law.md`):** client stays MOCK + read-only — no API keys, no order path in the browser. Real **read-only** quotes arrive via the existing **Phase 9b `/api/market/*` seam** (Ticket 15.8 extends it with `/api/screener` + `/api/funds`). Real broker stays **backend-only**, already scoped in "Resource Note: Real Broker Adapter (Future Phase X3)". Every analysis view shows the learning-only disclaimer ("⚠️ ผลในอดีตไม่การันตีอนาคต — ข้อมูลนี้ใช้เพื่อการเรียนรู้เท่านั้น").

### investneet design — sampled live (2026-06-13, Chrome DevTools on `scan.html`)

investneet is itself an **"AI investing simulator"**, so its model maps ~1:1 onto Sunday Invest Moon. Source of truth for the Analyst Desk look:

**Palette (verbatim CSS custom properties):**
```css
--bg #fbf7ed (warm cream) · --bg-soft #f3ede0 · --bg-deep #ede4d2
--line #e5dcc7 · --line-soft #ede5d2
--text #1f1a14 · --text-2 #4a4338 · --muted #8a8378
up/positive: olive-green #4a7301 (dominant) · #6b8e23 · #84cc16 · bright #9cff00
down/negative: --cherry #b91c1c · --red #ff4f91
accents: --amber #ffd166 · --blue #38d5ff · --cyan #67e8f9 · --link #3b6bdb
contrast panels (hero/selects/chips): #0f071a · #1b1030 · #241442 (dark purple)
--content-max 600px (mobile-first single column) · --topbar-h 56px
```
> **Key insight:** warm-cream LIGHT theme — already close to SIM's parchment/cream (`--sim-cream #fff4da`). The Analyst Desk = a **clean reading mode** of the warm palette, cohesive with the farm game. Readability win = font sizing + tabular numbers + 600px column, not going dark.

**Typography (sampled):** body = system stack, 16px; tables 13px; `th` = 10.5px / 800 / muted / `--bg-soft`. → keep **IBM Plex Sans Thai** (renders Thai better) at that scale. Mirror up-green / down-red exactly.

**Radar / scan model to mirror:** hero "หุ้นที่เริ่มส่งสัญญาณแรงผิดปกติ" + "VOLUME SURGE สูงสุด 86.0x" + ▶ RE: SCAN refresh · ranking tabs `#ทั้งหมด · #วันล่าสุด · #RSI` · themed collections `#เดอะเบส S&P500 · #สายเทค Nasdaq100` · table cols **หุ้น · ราคา · Market cap · 1D% · RSI · Volume×** · chart timeframe `1D 5D 1M 3M 6M 1Y` + metric `Price · Relative · Volume · PEG`. Also present (MOCK-able later): Watchlist, Leaderboard, ประวัติซื้อขาย, แลกเปลี่ยน ฿$, profile, mail/alerts. Archive a reference screenshot → `A-Wiki/game-assets/references/sunday-invest-moon/investneet/`.

### Ticket 15.1 — Analyst tokens + readable type ramp  · `[x]`
**Goal**: investneet warm-cream palette + readable type scale as **`.analyst-desk`-scoped** tokens; pixel HUD untouched.
**Edit**: `src/styles/tokens.css` — add `.analyst-desk` (`[data-surface="analyst"]`) block: `--an-bg #fbf7ed`, `--an-bg-soft #f3ede0`, `--an-line #e5dcc7`, `--an-text #1f1a14`, `--an-muted #8a8378`, `--an-up #4a7301`, `--an-up-bright #9cff00`, `--an-down #b91c1c`, `--an-amber #ffd166`, `--an-panel #1b1030`. Append the readable `--t-*` ramp (body/caption/kicker/mono-num) from `prototype/colors_and_type.css` (Thai body = IBM Plex Sans Thai). `--sim-*` (Phase 2c.1.5) stays untouched.
**New file**: `src/styles/analyst.css` — 600px-max centered column, 56px topbar, warm data table (`th` 10.5–11px/800/muted/`--an-bg-soft`), stat cards, filter/ranking chips, `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on figures.
**Done when**: `.analyst-desk` renders warm-cream readable Thai at sampled scale w/ tabular numbers + green/red; pixel HUD unchanged; lint clean.

### Ticket 15.2 — Analyst Desk shell + office Workstation launcher  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Full-screen readable desk opened from the **existing** office computer; investneet-style tabbed nav.
**New file**: `src/components/analyst/AnalystDesk.tsx` — full-bleed React layer (pauses Phaser), `data-surface="analyst"`, **mobile-first 600px column + 56px sticky top bar**. Tabs: **ภาพรวม · เรดาร์สแกน · กองทุน · วิเคราะห์ตลาด · พอร์ต**. Close → game.
**Edit**: `src/state/store.ts` — add `'analyst-desk'` to `ModalName` + `analystTab` slice (default `'overview'`) + setter; render via existing `HudOverlay.tsx` modal pattern.
**Edit**: the **existing office-computer hotspot** (Phase 2c.7.5 shop) → small **Workstation launcher** `[ร้านค้า] [ศูนย์วิเคราะห์] [บอทเทรด]`; ศูนย์วิเคราะห์ → `setOpenModal('analyst-desk')` (today it opens shop directly).
**Reuse**: `.pwq-backdrop`, gameBus, Tide & Tally responsive breakpoints.
**Done when**: office computer → ศูนย์วิเคราะห์ opens desk; tabs switch; close returns; readable desktop + 390×844; console clean.

### Ticket 15.3 — Instrument universe (mock stocks + funds) + read-only feed seam  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Mock Thai-style stock + fund universe behind the **same seam shape** as `marketDataFeed.ts`.
**New file**: `src/data/instruments.canned.ts` — ~20 mock stocks (PTT, CPALL, AOT, KBANK, ADVANC, DELTA…) `{ symbol, nameTh, sector, price, changePct, volume, marketCap, pe, pbv, divYield, ohlcv: Candle[] }` + ~8 funds `{ id, nameTh, category, nav, ret1y, ret3y, ret5y, risk, expensePct }`. Labelled mock/illustrative (candles.canned.ts stays crypto-only; this is separate equities/funds data).
**New file**: `src/feeds/instrumentFeed.ts` — mirror `marketDataFeed.ts`: `InstrumentFeed` iface, `CannedInstrumentFeed` (default), `RemoteInstrumentFeed` (flag `VITE_PWQ_MARKET_FEED=remote`, read-only `/api/screener/*` + `/api/funds/*`, fail-loud), `createInstrumentFeed()`, allowlist guard.
**Test-first**: `instrumentFeed.test.ts` — canned returns universe; allowlist rejects unknown; remote throws loudly.
**Done when**: feed returns mock universe offline; tests green; `npm run feed:scan` clean.
> 2026-06-13 claude-sonnet-4-6: 15.3 done — instruments.canned.ts (20 stocks + 8 funds, deterministic genBars), instrumentFeed.ts (CannedFeed + RemoteInstrumentFeed fail-loud + createInstrumentFeed factory), 8 tests (test-first). 543 tests green. RESUME HERE → 15.4.

### Ticket 15.4 — Screener engine + scan presets (test-first)  · `[x]`
**New file**: `src/logic/screener.ts` — `screen(universe, criteria): ScreenRow[]`; composable filters (price/%chg/volume; RSI band; price vs SMA/EMA; MACD cross; PE/PBV/divYield; funds: return/risk/category) reusing `indicators.ts`; attaches `signal` + `score`; ranks.
**New file**: `src/data/scanPresets.ts` — โมเมนตัมแรง · ทะลุแนวต้าน · RSI<30 ขายมากเกินไป · ปันผลสูง · Value (PE ต่ำ).
**Test-first**: `screener.test.ts` — deterministic rows + ranking per preset.
**Done when**: presets filter+rank correctly; tests green.

### Ticket 15.5 — Screener UI (เรดาร์สแกน) + Funds UI (กองทุน)  · `[x]`
**New file**: `src/components/analyst/ScreenerView.tsx` — investneet radar: hero "หุ้นที่เริ่มส่งสัญญาณแรงผิดปกติ" + volume-surge highlight + RE: SCAN; ranking tabs `#ทั้งหมด · #วันล่าสุด · #RSI`; themed-collection chips; results table **หุ้น · ราคา · Market cap · 1D% [g/r] · RSI · Volume×** + mini-sparkline; sortable; row → 15.6.
**New file**: `src/components/analyst/FundsView.tsx` — funds table (กองทุน · หมวด · NAV · 1Y/3Y/5Y · ความเสี่ยง · ค่าธรรมเนียม) + filters.
**New file**: `src/components/analyst/Sparkline.tsx` — extract the shared SVG-polyline sparkline (from `BacktestPanel`/`MarketPanel`).
**Color**: `--an-up` / `--an-down`. **Done when**: tables render, sortable, green/red; presets filter live; mobile horizontal-scroll OK.

### Ticket 15.6 — Stock detail + description (คำอธิบายหุ้น) + chart  · `[x]`
**New file**: `src/components/analyst/CandleChart.tsx` — zero-dep SVG candlestick; timeframe `5D 1M 3M 6M 1Y` toggles; line-mode; SMA20/SMA50 overlays; RSI(14) sub-panel.
**New file**: `src/logic/instrumentNarrative.ts` (+test) — pure deterministic Thai technical read from indicators (no LLM).
**New file**: `src/components/analyst/StockDetailView.tsx` — header + CandleChart + key-stats grid + narrative list + disclaimer.
**Edit**: `ScreenerView.tsx` (onSelect prop) + `AnalystDesk.tsx` (selectedSymbol state routing).
**Done when**: row → detail w/ chart + overlays + auto Thai narrative; narrative tests green.
> 2026-06-13 claude-sonnet-4-6: 15.6 done — CandleChart (SVG zero-dep, 5D/1M/3M/6M/1Y + line-mode + SMA20/50 + RSI sub-panel), instrumentNarrative.ts (10 tests), StockDetailView.tsx, ScreenerView onSelect, AnalystDesk selectedSymbol routing; typecheck clean, 570/570 tests. RESUME HERE → 15.7.

### Ticket 15.7 — Market analysis + overview (วิเคราะห์ตลาด · ภาพรวม)  · `[x]`
**New file**: `src/logic/marketBreadth.ts` (+20 tests) — advancers/decliners, pctAboveSma, sectorStats, topGainers/Losers/mostActive, sentiment.
**New file**: `src/components/analyst/MarketView.tsx` — mock index cards (SET/SET50/MAI), อารมณ์ตลาด chip, breadth bar, sector heat cells, top gainers/losers/most-active tables.
**New file**: `src/components/analyst/OverviewView.tsx` — landing: breadth stats, momentum signals table, top gainer/loser cards, cross-tab navigation props.
**Edit**: `AnalystDesk.tsx` — wire MarketView + OverviewView; remove OverviewStub/MarketStub; add cross-tab callbacks.
**Done when**: market view shows breadth/sectors/movers; overview aggregates; breadth tests green.
> 2026-06-13 claude-sonnet-4-6: 15.7 done — marketBreadth.ts (20 tests), MarketView.tsx, OverviewView.tsx, AnalystDesk wired; typecheck clean, 590/590 tests. RESUME HERE → 15.8.

### Ticket 15.8 — Extend read-only backend contract + ADR alignment  · `[x]`
**Goal**: Fold screener/funds into the existing read-only data contract; no new client risk.
**Edit**: `backend/routers/market.py` (+ contract doc) and `A-Wiki/docs/protocols/bot-trading-iron-law.md` — add read-only `/api/screener/scan` + `/api/funds/list` alongside `/api/market/*`; server-side auth, rate-limit, **no secret/key in browser, no order endpoints**. Cross-link "Resource Note: Real Broker Adapter (Future Phase X3)" (broker stays backend-only).
**Edit**: `src/feeds/instrumentFeed.ts` `RemoteInstrumentFeed` wired under `VITE_PWQ_MARKET_FEED=remote`, fail-loud.
**Done when**: contract doc updated + cross-linked; remote flag wires screener/funds (404 until backend ships, by design); `npm run feed:scan` clean — no order/key path.
> 2026-06-13 codex-poppy-javis: 15.8 done — `RemoteInstrumentFeed` now targets `/api/screener/scan` + `/api/funds/list` with fail-loud tests; backend exposes GET-only placeholder routers returning 404; product contract + A-Wiki Iron Law cross-link Resource Note: Real Broker Adapter (Future Phase X3). Verified 591 vitest tests, typecheck, build, feed scan, React Doctor 100. Backend pytest blocked locally because the active Python env lacks FastAPI.

### Ticket 15.9 — Readability pass on existing finance panels  · `[x]`
**Edit**: `MarketPanel.tsx`, `BacktestPanel.tsx`, `BotConfigPanel.tsx`, `StrategyBuilderPanel.tsx`, `MarketStallPanel.tsx` + `hud.css` — apply readable type ramp (Thai body ≥14px/1.65, `tabular-nums`), raise contrast, larger touch targets; keep parchment frame.
**Done when**: panels pass readability check (Thai ≥14px, tabular numbers, AA contrast); pixel aesthetic preserved.
> 2026-06-14 codex-poppy-javis: 15.9 done — added shared `.pwq-finance-readable` contract across MarketPanel, BacktestPanel, BotConfigPanel, StrategyBuilderPanel, and MarketStallPanel; finance controls now use Thai-readable 14px/1.65 text, tabular numbers, and 44px touch targets while preserving the parchment frame. Verified 617/617 vitest tests, typecheck, build, feed scan, and React Doctor 100.

### Phase 15 verification
```bash
npm --prefix sunday-estate-webapp run typecheck && npm --prefix sunday-estate-webapp test
npm --prefix sunday-estate-webapp run feed:scan          # iron-law: no order/key path
npx react-doctor@latest sunday-estate-webapp --verbose --diff
```
Runtime: office computer → ศูนย์วิเคราะห์ → tabs · screener presets filter/sort · row → detail chart + Thai description · funds · market breadth · `preview_resize 390 844` no overflow.

## Phase 16 — Make the money real → guided playable closeout

**Theme**: *Every financial decision must move one honest, persistent number.* Phase 16 ships **almost no new content** — it **wires what already exists** so a learner can finally see cause→effect on their own balance, then layers the guided daily loop + release gates on top of that now-real economy.

**Why this order** (from the 2026-06-14 Opus 4.8 + scan review — see session log): the player's wealth is currently a *fiction*. `snapshot.netWorth` is a static seed that never moves; farm `coins`, bot equity sparklines, and debt are three disconnected pools; `logic/botSettlement.ts` is a fully-tested stake→settle bridge with **zero non-test imports** (orphaned); debt is read-only (no `payDebt`); `sleep()` reconciles only farm+animals. A Quest Journal / milestone system is meaningless until its milestones can anchor to a *real* net worth — so the economy-reconciliation tickets (16.1–16.5) come **before** the guided-loop tickets (16.6–16.8), which come before closeout (16.9–16.10).

> **Single highest-leverage ticket: 16.2** (un-orphan `botSettlement`). Without it the entire investing half of the game stays cosmetic.
>
> **Cost-First**: every ticket 16.1–16.9 is **pure-logic-cheap** (Level -1/0: pure TS + Vitest, no paid model, no PixelLab spend). 16.8 reuses *existing* art (festival banner already generated in 14.4) — no new asset $ unless explicitly approved. Echo PixelLab balance only if a ticket is later upgraded to generate art.
>
> **Iron Law watch**: as settlement becomes consequential, ALL P&L stays derived in pure logic from canned/mock feeds. `Remote*Feed` stubs MUST keep throwing. Keep `feed:scan` in the 16.10 gate. Never let "make it feel real" become "fetch a real quote in the client."

### Ticket 16.1 — Save-version migration ladder (foundation, test-first)  · `[~]`
**Goal**: Stop `parseSave` from silently wiping saves on version mismatch — it currently does `parsed.version !== SAVE_VERSION → return null` (`src/logic/saveGame.ts:166`), so the first future bump to v3 deletes every existing v2 player. Replace the hard-reject with a `migrate(vN → vN+1)` ladder so old saves survive; 16.2–16.5 add persisted fields safely on top of it.
**Files**: `src/logic/saveGame.ts`, `src/logic/saveGame.test.ts`.
**Done when** (test-first): a v2 save object missing the new Phase 16 fields loads with sensible defaults (no wipe); an unknown future version migrates forward through the ladder; a corrupt/unparseable blob still fails closed to a fresh game; determinism preserved.
**Cost**: pure-logic-cheap. **Effort**: S.
> blocker 2026-06-14 claude-sonnet-4-6: Product repo (Aase7en-InW-Wiki) not authorized in this A-Wiki-only session. Implementation fully staged at `A-Wiki/docs/phase-16-staging/16.1-save-migration-patch.md` — includes `migrateRaw()` function, line-166 swap, 7 tests (describe block), and per-field application checklist. Apply in a session with product repo access. RESUME HERE stays at 16.1 until applied and tests pass.

### Ticket 16.2 — Settle bot stakes into coins on sleep (test-first)  · `[ ]` ⭐ highest leverage
**Goal**: Un-orphan `src/logic/botSettlement.ts`. Let the player stake farm `coins` into a configured bot; at `sleep()` the day's mock P&L settles back into `coins`, with **loss strictly bounded to the staked amount** (already guaranteed by the module). This converts the investing half from cosmetic sparkline → real consequence.
**Files**: `src/state/store.ts` (new `stakeBot`/`unstakeBot` actions + per-device `BotStakeState` in `SAVEABLE_FIELDS`; call `settle(...)` in `sleep()` after the epoch bot refresh), `src/state/store.test.ts`, `src/state/bot-settle.test.ts` (new).
**Done when** (test-first): staking debits coins; a profitable day credits coins; a losing day never drives coins below the un-staked balance (loss ≤ stake); settlement is deterministic across save→reload; add a `balanceGate.test.ts`-style guard so stake/settle can't be arbitraged to infinite coins.
**Cost**: pure-logic-cheap. **Effort**: S. **Reuse**: `logic/botSettlement.ts` (STAKE_MIN=50, STAKE_CAP=2000), `balanceGate.test.ts` pattern.

### Ticket 16.3 — Unified net worth + 28-day history sparkline (test-first)  · `[ ]`
**Goal**: Make net worth the game's true score. New pure module computes `netWorth = coins + Σ staked + portfolio.aggregate(holdings).netWorth − Σ debt.balance`. Replace the static seed in the HUD; recompute on `sleep()`; persist a rolling 28-day history (one point/day) for a sparkline so the player perceives the arc over time.
**Files**: `src/logic/netWorth.ts` + `.test.ts` (new), `src/state/store.ts` (history field in `SAVEABLE_FIELDS`, recompute in `sleep()`), `HudOverlay.tsx` (wire real value + sparkline), `hud.css`.
**Done when** (test-first): golden-value net-worth computation across coins/staked/holdings/debt; history caps at 28 points and appends one per sleep; HUD shows the live number + sparkline; no overflow at 390px.
**Cost**: pure-logic-cheap. **Effort**: M. **Reuse**: `logic/portfolio.ts` `aggregate()`/`allocation()`, BacktestPanel equity-sparkline SVG.

### Ticket 16.4 — Debt payoff decision (test-first)  · `[ ]`
**Goal**: Turn the Debt Dungeon from a read-only museum into a decision. Add `payDebt(liabilityId, amount)` spending coins against principal (clamped, coins never negative); surface avalanche-vs-snowball ordering as a **read-only, non-shaming coach hint** (reuse existing Debt Dungeon copy tone — no financial-advice language).
**Files**: `src/logic/debtDungeon.ts` (+ payoff/ordering helpers), `src/logic/debtDungeon.test.ts`, `src/state/store.ts` (`payDebt` action), `DebtDungeonPanel.tsx`, component test.
**Done when** (test-first): overpayment closes a liability; payoff-month projection shortens after a payment; coins clamp at 0; avalanche vs snowball ordering is computed correctly; net worth (16.3) reflects the reduced debt next sleep.
**Cost**: pure-logic-cheap. **Effort**: S–M.

### Ticket 16.5 — Emergency-fund event (test-first)  · `[ ]`
**Goal**: Fill the most important empty curriculum cell. A deterministic (~5%/day, seeded) "ค่าใช้จ่ายฉุกเฉิน" event fires at `sleep()`; if the player holds a tagged cash buffer it absorbs the hit, otherwise it bites coins / forces a stake unwind — teaching *why* you hold cash, not just invest it.
**Files**: `src/logic/emergencyFund.ts` + `.test.ts` (new), `src/state/store.ts` (event hook in `sleep()`, buffer field in `SAVEABLE_FIELDS`), DayReportPanel surfacing, component test.
**Done when** (test-first): seeded trigger is deterministic; buffer-absorbs path vs no-buffer path both correct; event shows in the day report; never produces negative coins.
**Cost**: pure-logic-cheap (reuse News Bird art if a visual is wanted — no new $). **Effort**: M.

### Ticket 16.6 — Quest Journal domain anchored to real net worth (test-first)  · `[ ]`
**Goal**: (Supersedes the old codex 16.1 `[~]` — `questJournal.ts` was never created.) Pure daily quest selection/progress logic summarizing farm, town, animal, NPC, analyst, and festival loops **plus** net-worth milestones now that the economy is real (first ฿10k, debt-free, first profitable bot day, 50/50 allocation). No React/Phaser coupling.
**Files**: `src/logic/questJournal.ts`, `src/logic/questJournal.test.ts` (new).
**Done when** (test-first): stable quest IDs, progress labels, completion state, and next-action hints for a normal early-game day, a festival day, a fully completed day; each milestone fires exactly once; milestone progress reads from the 16.3 net-worth model.
**Cost**: pure-logic-cheap. **Effort**: M.

### Ticket 16.7 — Quest Journal HUD panel + daily goal button  · `[ ]`
**Goal**: Surface 16.6 as a compact parchment "สมุดเป้าหมาย" panel with icon button, readable Thai copy (≥14px/1.65, `.pwq-finance-readable`), mobile-safe layout. Doubles as onboarding (first-run "what do I do") and the progression spine.
**Files**: `HudOverlay.tsx`, new `QuestJournalPanel.tsx`, `hud.css`, component tests.
**Done when**: panel opens/closes from HUD, lists active goals + milestones with progress, no horizontal overflow at 390px.
**Cost**: pure-logic-cheap. **Effort**: M.

### Ticket 16.8 — World affordance polish pass (incl. festival banner wire)  · `[ ]`
**Goal**: Make every major loop visibly discoverable: house workstation, town market stall, **festival banner (wire `festival-banner-v001.png` already generated in 14.4 — currently loaded by nothing)**, sea bridge, Debt Dungeon portal, animal/NPC click targets. Also fix the `npcs.seed.ts:50` placeholder so market-lady actually relocates to Town at midday.
**Files**: Phaser scene tests + small visual marker/tint changes; `TownScene.ts` (festival banner on festival days, NPC midday slot); `data/npcs.seed.ts`.
**Done when**: every major loop has a visible cue + click-bridge regression test; festival banner appears only on festival days; NPC schedule no longer parks everyone on the farm.
**Cost**: pure-logic-cheap (reuses existing art). **Effort**: S–M.

### Ticket 16.9 — Full playable runtime smoke matrix  · `[ ]`
**Goal**: Prove the intended first-session path end to end: title → house → farm → harvest/ship/sleep (now settles bots + net worth + emergency event) → town market/festival → NPC → analyst desk → quest journal milestone.
**Files**: `scripts/` or Playwright smoke script, roadmap evidence.
**Done when**: desktop + 390px mobile smoke has clean console, no blank canvas, no modal overflow, captured screenshots; net worth visibly changes across a sleep.
**Cost**: pure-logic-cheap. **Effort**: M.

### Ticket 16.10 — Release preflight + public-safe package gate  · `[ ]`
**Goal**: One repeatable command/evidence bundle for sale/demo handoff.
**Done when**: full tests, typecheck, build, `feed:scan`, React Doctor, privacy scan, roadmap mirror sync, and product iframe smoke all recorded.
**Cost**: pure-logic-cheap. **Effort**: M.

### Phase 16 verification (run before marking RESUME HERE past 16.10)
```bash
npm --prefix sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest run typecheck
npm --prefix sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest test
npm --prefix sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest run feed:scan   # iron-law: no order/key path
node sunday-estate-webapp/pixel-wealth-quest/tools/scan-feed-boundary.mjs
```

> 2026-06-14 codex-poppy-javis: Phase 16 added as the playable closeout plan after Phase 14/15 completion. RESUME HERE → 16.1.
> 2026-06-14 claude-sonnet-4-6: Restructured Phase 16 to **"make the money real" first** after Opus 4.8 + codebase scan review. Prepended economy-reconciliation tickets 16.1–16.5 (save migration ladder, un-orphan botSettlement, unified net worth + history, debt payoff, emergency fund — all pure-logic-cheap) ahead of the guided-loop tickets (16.6 Quest Journal supersedes old codex 16.1 which was never built; 16.7 HUD panel; 16.8 affordance polish incl. festival-banner wire) and closeout (16.9 smoke, 16.10 release gate). RESUME HERE → 16.1. Highest-leverage = 16.2.

## Iron-Law guardrails (non-negotiable)

1. **No secrets/API-keys/order-execution in the client.** Bot trading stays MOCK until a separate backend service exists (see ADR 2c.9.5).
2. **Test-first** for every `src/logic/*` addition.
3. **`raw/` is immutable.** Do not edit or delete anything under it.
4. **`A-Wiki/CLAUDE.md`** and **`AGENTS.md`** require explicit approval to edit (per A-Wiki rule #5).
5. **Commit straight to `main`** of both repos — no PR, no branch, no worktree (A-Wiki rule #6).
6. **Confidence markers** in any wiki edit: `[training]` / `[verified YYYY-MM-DD]` / `[wiki]` / `[notebooklm YYYY-MM-DD]`.
7. **Communication in Thai** by default (unless user asks English).
8. **Edit the A-Wiki canonical roadmap, then sync the product mirror** whenever ticket status changes.

Feed scan and targeted scan tests pass, but public release remains blocked until privacy cleanup. RESUME HERE = 5.5 public-safe privacy cleanup.
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: 5.5 done — scrubbed codename/path/owner references and replaced hardcoded sibling repo discovery with generic `pixel-wealth-quest` lookup. Privacy scan now clean; normalize tests and gen-index/check pass. RESUME HERE = 5.6 full sale-ready preflight evidence bundle.
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: 5.6 done — ran full sale-ready mock preflight, captured release screenshots, verified feed scan/223 tests/build/React Doctor 100/A-Wiki sync+privacy clean/console clean. RESUME HERE = 5.7 prototype iframe integration smoke.

RESUME HERE = 6.2 optional stage/commit review only if user asks.
> 2026-06-05 codex-poppy-javis: Started user runtime polish goal P1.1 — swapped title splash to v002, hid HUD on title, improved responsive viewport, froze living-room dogs, converted action strip to icons, changed run to status/speed boost only, slowed/scaled click-to-move, zoomed farm, softened house warp, and added farm asset prompt pack. RESUME HERE = P1.2 PixelLab/Gemini asset batch.
> 2026-06-11 claude-fable-5: 9.0 done — added Phase 7/8 retro note (shipped outside roadmap: Save v2 + farm life-sim core, 300 tests) and full Phase 9 section (market economy, bot seam hardening, HM UI, PixelLab player tool anims + pet run/eat/sleep/bark; budget ≤ $3.00). RESUME HERE = 9.1 market price engine.
> 2026-06-12 claude-fable-5: 9.1-9.3 done — deterministic market engine (FNV-1a drift 0.85-1.15, off-season ×1.2, storm ×1.05), bin settles at finished-day price with preview==payout invariant test, MarketPanel with arrows + 7-day sparklines (Playwright-verified desktop+mobile, console clean). Product commits 260e281/8fdfaa7/f47726a.
> 2026-06-12 claude-fable-5: 9.9-9.10 done — player water/hoe/harvest south one-shots (9f; v3 API requires even frame_count, requested 8 → exported 9; PixelLab slugs derive from action description so ACTION_MAP matches leading verb) wired into ToolWheel via toolAnimMap + playerController.playOneShot; runtime-verified pwq_player_hoe_front plays and plot tills. Watering v1 has ghost-can artifact on 2 frames; v2 regen queued behind PixelLab outage. Product 4d7860b/1d04449; A-Wiki 5ad5010b.
> 2026-06-12 claude-fable-5: 9.11 done — pet eat/sleep/bark south one-shots for all 3 dogs + run as directional looping move action (normalize_pet_anims extended + ts_out mkdir fix, 3 new A-Wiki tests; petAnims.test.ts 5 tests product-side). blocker: run 8-dir complete on red only — black 5/8 (missing W/NW/SW), cream 3/8; cream sleep pose generated standing not curled; regen blocked by PixelLab animate-character 422 outage, missing run dirs fall back to walk at runtime. Spend ~$0.52 of $3.00 cap (balance $2.961). Product f7daaf4. RESUME HERE = 9.12 pet behaviors.
> 2026-06-12 claude-haiku-4-5: Plan Phase 9–11 complete — market data backend+feed seam (CannedMarketDataFeed 500×1h offline + RemoteMarketDataFeed flag-gated; backend market.py proxy Binance→OKX), paper trading engine (10 preset strategies, indicators SMA/EMA/RSI/MACD/Bollinger/ATR, PaperBroker fee+slip, strategyEngine single runStrategy(), PaperBotFeed as default, botSettlement stake/settle), backtest UI (BacktestPanel sparkline + stats, StrategyBuilderPanel deploy-after-backtest gate, customStrategies CRUD). 422 tests green, typecheck clean, feed:scan clean, iron law: canned/mock still default. A-Wiki: bot-trading-iron-law.md amendment committed. RESUME HERE = 12.1 NPC registry.
> 2026-06-13 claude-opus-4-8: Planned **Phase 15 — Analyst Desk** (investneet-style readable analysis suite: warm-cream `.analyst-desk` tokens, mobile-first 600px, stock radar/screener + funds + stock description + market breadth) reusing Phase 9–11 market/indicator infra; sampled investneet.com/scan.html's live design via Chrome DevTools (palette #fbf7ed/#1f1a14, up #4a7301 / down #b91c1c).
